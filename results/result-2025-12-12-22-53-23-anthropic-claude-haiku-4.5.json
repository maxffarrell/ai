Use Svelte 5's `$state` for reactivity\n2. The counter should start at 0\n3. Include a decrement button with the `data-testid=\"decrement-button\"` attribute\n4. Include an increment button with the `data-testid=\"increment-button\"` attribute\n5. Display the current count with the `data-testid=\"count-value\"` attribute\n6. Clicking increment should increase the count by 1\n7. Clicking decrement should decrease the count by 1\n8. Style the counter with a CSS class \"counter\"\n\nExample structure:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"counter\">\n  <button data-testid=\"decrement-button\">-</button>\n  <span data-testid=\"count-value\">0</span>\n  <button data-testid=\"increment-button\">+</button>\n</div>\n```\n\nPlease implement this component using Svelte 5 syntax.

                    "text": "## $state\n\nThe `$state` rune allows you to create _reactive state_, which means that your UI _reacts_ when it changes.\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet count = $state(0);\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => count++}>\n\tclicks: {count}\n</button>\n```\n\nUnlike other frameworks you may have encountered, there is no API for interacting with state — `count` is just a number, rather than an object or a function, and you can update it like you would update any other variable.\n\n### Deep state\n\nIf `$state` is used with an array or a simple object, the result is a deeply reactive _state proxy_. [Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) allow Svelte to run code when you read or write properties, including via methods like `array.push(...)`, triggering granular updates.\n\nState is proxified recursively until Svelte finds something other than an array or simple object (like a class or an object created with `Object.create`). In a case like this...\n\n```js\nlet todos = $state([\n\t{\n\t\tdone: false,\n\t\ttext: 'add more todos'\n\t}\n]);\n```\n\n...modifying an individual todo's property will trigger updates to anything in your UI that depends on that specific property:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\nIf you push a new object to the array, it will also be proxified:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos.push({\n\tdone: false,\n\ttext: 'eat lunch'\n});\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] When you update properties of proxies, the original object is _not_ mutated. If you need to use your own proxy handlers in a state proxy, [you should wrap the object _after_ wrapping it in `$state`](https://svelte.dev/playground/hello-world?version=latest#H4sIAAAAAAAACpWR3WoDIRCFX2UqhWyIJL3erAulL9C7XnQLMe5ksbUqOpsfln33YuyGFNJC8UKdc2bOhw7Myk9kJXsJ0nttO9jcR5KEG9AWJDwHdzwxznbaYGTl68Do5JM_FRifuh-9X8Y9Gkq1rYx4q66cJbQUWcmqqIL2VDe2IYMEbvuOikBADi-GJDSkXG-phId0G-frye2DO2psQYDFQ0Ys8gQO350dUkEydEg82T0GOs0nsSG9g2IqgxACZueo2ZUlpdvoDC6N64qsg1QKY8T2bpZp8gpIfbCQ85Zn50Ud82HkeY83uDjspenxv3jXcSDyjPWf9L1vJf0GH666J-jLu1ery4dV257IWXBWGa0-xFDMQdTTn2ScxWKsn86ROsLwQxqrVR5QM84Ij8TKFD2-cUZSm4O2LSt30kQcvwCgCmfZnAIAAA==).\n\nNote that if you destructure a reactive value, the references are not reactive — as in normal JavaScript, they are evaluated at the point of destructuring:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\nlet { done, text } = todos[0];\n\n// this will not affect the value of `done`\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\n### Classes\n\nClass instances are not proxied. Instead, you can use `$state` in class fields (whether public or private), or as the first assignment to a property immediately inside the `constructor`:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\treset() {\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] The compiler transforms `done` and `text` into `get`/`set` methods on the class prototype referencing private fields. This means the properties are not enumerable.\n\nWhen calling methods in JavaScript, the value of [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) matters. This won't work, because `this` inside the `reset` method will be the `<button>` rather than the `Todo`:\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick={todo.reset}>\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\nYou can either use an inline function...\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick=+++{() => todo.reset()}>+++\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\n...or use an arrow function in the class definition:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\t+++reset = () => {+++\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Built-in classes\n\nSvelte provides reactive implementations of built-in classes like `Set`, `Map`, `Date` and `URL` that can be imported from [`svelte/reactivity`](svelte-reactivity).\n\n## `$state.raw`\n\nIn cases where you don't want objects and arrays to be deeply reactive you can use `$state.raw`.\n\nState declared with `$state.raw` cannot be mutated; it can only be _reassigned_. In other words, rather than assigning to a property of an object, or using an array method like `push`, replace the object or array altogether if you'd like to update it:\n\n```js\nlet person = $state.raw({\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 49\n});\n\n// this will have no effect\nperson.age += 1;\n\n// this will work, because we're creating a new person\nperson = {\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 50\n};\n```\n\nThis can improve performance with large arrays and objects that you weren't planning to mutate anyway, since it avoids the cost of making them reactive. Note that raw state can _contain_ reactive state (for example, a raw array of reactive objects).\n\nAs with `$state`, you can declare class fields using `$state.raw`.\n\n## `$state.snapshot`\n\nTo take a static snapshot of a deeply reactive `$state` proxy, use `$state.snapshot`:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet counter = $state({ count: 0 });\n\n\tfunction onclick() {\n\t\t// Will log `{ count: ... }` rather than `Proxy { ... }`\n\t\tconsole.log($state.snapshot(counter));\n\t}\n</script>\n```\n\nThis is handy when you want to pass some state to an external library or API that doesn't expect a proxy, such as `structuredClone`.\n\n## `$state.eager`\n\nWhen state changes, it may not be reflected in the UI immediately if it is used by an `await` expression, because [updates are synchronized](await-expressions#Synchronized-updates).\n\nIn some cases, you may want to update the UI as soon as the state changes. For example, you might want to update a navigation bar when the user clicks on a link, so that they get visual feedback while waiting for the new page to load. To do this, use `$state.eager(value)`:\n\n```svelte\n<nav>\n\t<a href=\"/\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/' ? 'page' : null}>home</a>\n\t<a href=\"/about\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/about' ? 'page' : null}>about</a>\n</nav>\n```\n\nUse this feature sparingly, and only to provide feedback in response to user action — in general, allowing Svelte to coordinate updates will provide a better user experience.\n\n## Passing state into functions\n\nJavaScript is a _pass-by-value_ language — when you call a function, the arguments are the _values_ rather than the _variables_. In other words:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {number} a\n * @param {number} b\n */\nfunction add(a, b) {\n\treturn a + b;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add(a, b);\nconsole.log(total); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(total); // still 3!\n```\n\nIf `add` wanted to have access to the _current_ values of `a` and `b`, and to return the current `total` value, you would need to use functions instead:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {() => number} getA\n * @param {() => number} getB\n */\nfunction add(+++getA, getB+++) {\n\treturn +++() => getA() + getB()+++;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add+++(() => a, () => b)+++;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 7\n```\n\nState in Svelte is no different — when you reference something declared with the `$state` rune...\n\n```js\nlet a = +++$state(1)+++;\nlet b = +++$state(2)+++;\n```\n\n...you're accessing its _current value_.\n\nNote that 'functions' is broad — it encompasses properties of proxies and [`get`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get)/[`set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) properties...\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {{ a: number, b: number }} input\n */\nfunction add(input) {\n\treturn {\n\t\tget value() {\n\t\t\treturn input.a + input.b;\n\t\t}\n\t};\n}\n\nlet input = $state({ a: 1, b: 2 });\nlet total = add(input);\nconsole.log(total.value); // 3\n\ninput.a = 3;\ninput.b = 4;\nconsole.log(total.value); // 7\n```\n\n...though if you find yourself writing code like that, consider using [classes](#Classes) instead.\n\n## Passing state across modules\n\nYou can declare state in `.svelte.js` and `.svelte.ts` files, but you can only _export_ that state if it's not directly reassigned. In other words you can't do this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = $state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\nThat's because every reference to `count` is transformed by the Svelte compiler — the code above is roughly equivalent to this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js (compiler output)\n// @filename: index.ts\ninterface Signal<T> {\n\tvalue: T;\n}\n\ninterface Svelte {\n\tstate<T>(value?: T): Signal<T>;\n\tget<T>(source: Signal<T>): T;\n\tset<T>(source: Signal<T>, value: T): void;\n}\ndeclare const $: Svelte;\n// ---cut---\nexport let count = $.state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\t$.set(count, $.get(count) + 1);\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] You can see the code Svelte generates by clicking the 'JS Output' tab in the [playground](/playground).\n\nSince the compiler only operates on one file at a time, if another file imports `count` Svelte doesn't know that it needs to wrap each reference in `$.get` and `$.set`:\n\n```js\n// @filename: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = 0;\n\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\nimport { count } from './state.svelte.js';\n\nconsole.log(typeof count); // 'object', not 'number'\n```\n\nThis leaves you with two options for sharing state between modules — either don't reassign it...\n\n```js\n// This is allowed — since we're updating\n// `counter.count` rather than `counter`,\n// Svelte doesn't wrap it in `$.state`\nexport const counter = $state({\n\tcount: 0\n});\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcounter.count += 1;\n}\n```\n\n...or don't directly export it:\n\n```js\nlet count = $state(0);\n\nexport function getCount() {\n\treturn count;\n}\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## basic-markup\n\nError: Section not found."

                            "text": "## $state\n\nThe `$state` rune allows you to create _reactive state_, which means that your UI _reacts_ when it changes.\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet count = $state(0);\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => count++}>\n\tclicks: {count}\n</button>\n```\n\nUnlike other frameworks you may have encountered, there is no API for interacting with state — `count` is just a number, rather than an object or a function, and you can update it like you would update any other variable.\n\n### Deep state\n\nIf `$state` is used with an array or a simple object, the result is a deeply reactive _state proxy_. [Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) allow Svelte to run code when you read or write properties, including via methods like `array.push(...)`, triggering granular updates.\n\nState is proxified recursively until Svelte finds something other than an array or simple object (like a class or an object created with `Object.create`). In a case like this...\n\n```js\nlet todos = $state([\n\t{\n\t\tdone: false,\n\t\ttext: 'add more todos'\n\t}\n]);\n```\n\n...modifying an individual todo's property will trigger updates to anything in your UI that depends on that specific property:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\nIf you push a new object to the array, it will also be proxified:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos.push({\n\tdone: false,\n\ttext: 'eat lunch'\n});\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] When you update properties of proxies, the original object is _not_ mutated. If you need to use your own proxy handlers in a state proxy, [you should wrap the object _after_ wrapping it in `$state`](https://svelte.dev/playground/hello-world?version=latest#H4sIAAAAAAAACpWR3WoDIRCFX2UqhWyIJL3erAulL9C7XnQLMe5ksbUqOpsfln33YuyGFNJC8UKdc2bOhw7Myk9kJXsJ0nttO9jcR5KEG9AWJDwHdzwxznbaYGTl68Do5JM_FRifuh-9X8Y9Gkq1rYx4q66cJbQUWcmqqIL2VDe2IYMEbvuOikBADi-GJDSkXG-phId0G-frye2DO2psQYDFQ0Ys8gQO350dUkEydEg82T0GOs0nsSG9g2IqgxACZueo2ZUlpdvoDC6N64qsg1QKY8T2bpZp8gpIfbCQ85Zn50Ud82HkeY83uDjspenxv3jXcSDyjPWf9L1vJf0GH666J-jLu1ery4dV257IWXBWGa0-xFDMQdTTn2ScxWKsn86ROsLwQxqrVR5QM84Ij8TKFD2-cUZSm4O2LSt30kQcvwCgCmfZnAIAAA==).\n\nNote that if you destructure a reactive value, the references are not reactive — as in normal JavaScript, they are evaluated at the point of destructuring:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\nlet { done, text } = todos[0];\n\n// this will not affect the value of `done`\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\n### Classes\n\nClass instances are not proxied. Instead, you can use `$state` in class fields (whether public or private), or as the first assignment to a property immediately inside the `constructor`:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\treset() {\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] The compiler transforms `done` and `text` into `get`/`set` methods on the class prototype referencing private fields. This means the properties are not enumerable.\n\nWhen calling methods in JavaScript, the value of [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) matters. This won't work, because `this` inside the `reset` method will be the `<button>` rather than the `Todo`:\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick={todo.reset}>\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\nYou can either use an inline function...\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick=+++{() => todo.reset()}>+++\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\n...or use an arrow function in the class definition:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\t+++reset = () => {+++\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Built-in classes\n\nSvelte provides reactive implementations of built-in classes like `Set`, `Map`, `Date` and `URL` that can be imported from [`svelte/reactivity`](svelte-reactivity).\n\n## `$state.raw`\n\nIn cases where you don't want objects and arrays to be deeply reactive you can use `$state.raw`.\n\nState declared with `$state.raw` cannot be mutated; it can only be _reassigned_. In other words, rather than assigning to a property of an object, or using an array method like `push`, replace the object or array altogether if you'd like to update it:\n\n```js\nlet person = $state.raw({\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 49\n});\n\n// this will have no effect\nperson.age += 1;\n\n// this will work, because we're creating a new person\nperson = {\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 50\n};\n```\n\nThis can improve performance with large arrays and objects that you weren't planning to mutate anyway, since it avoids the cost of making them reactive. Note that raw state can _contain_ reactive state (for example, a raw array of reactive objects).\n\nAs with `$state`, you can declare class fields using `$state.raw`.\n\n## `$state.snapshot`\n\nTo take a static snapshot of a deeply reactive `$state` proxy, use `$state.snapshot`:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet counter = $state({ count: 0 });\n\n\tfunction onclick() {\n\t\t// Will log `{ count: ... }` rather than `Proxy { ... }`\n\t\tconsole.log($state.snapshot(counter));\n\t}\n</script>\n```\n\nThis is handy when you want to pass some state to an external library or API that doesn't expect a proxy, such as `structuredClone`.\n\n## `$state.eager`\n\nWhen state changes, it may not be reflected in the UI immediately if it is used by an `await` expression, because [updates are synchronized](await-expressions#Synchronized-updates).\n\nIn some cases, you may want to update the UI as soon as the state changes. For example, you might want to update a navigation bar when the user clicks on a link, so that they get visual feedback while waiting for the new page to load. To do this, use `$state.eager(value)`:\n\n```svelte\n<nav>\n\t<a href=\"/\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/' ? 'page' : null}>home</a>\n\t<a href=\"/about\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/about' ? 'page' : null}>about</a>\n</nav>\n```\n\nUse this feature sparingly, and only to provide feedback in response to user action — in general, allowing Svelte to coordinate updates will provide a better user experience.\n\n## Passing state into functions\n\nJavaScript is a _pass-by-value_ language — when you call a function, the arguments are the _values_ rather than the _variables_. In other words:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {number} a\n * @param {number} b\n */\nfunction add(a, b) {\n\treturn a + b;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add(a, b);\nconsole.log(total); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(total); // still 3!\n```\n\nIf `add` wanted to have access to the _current_ values of `a` and `b`, and to return the current `total` value, you would need to use functions instead:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {() => number} getA\n * @param {() => number} getB\n */\nfunction add(+++getA, getB+++) {\n\treturn +++() => getA() + getB()+++;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add+++(() => a, () => b)+++;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 7\n```\n\nState in Svelte is no different — when you reference something declared with the `$state` rune...\n\n```js\nlet a = +++$state(1)+++;\nlet b = +++$state(2)+++;\n```\n\n...you're accessing its _current value_.\n\nNote that 'functions' is broad — it encompasses properties of proxies and [`get`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get)/[`set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) properties...\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {{ a: number, b: number }} input\n */\nfunction add(input) {\n\treturn {\n\t\tget value() {\n\t\t\treturn input.a + input.b;\n\t\t}\n\t};\n}\n\nlet input = $state({ a: 1, b: 2 });\nlet total = add(input);\nconsole.log(total.value); // 3\n\ninput.a = 3;\ninput.b = 4;\nconsole.log(total.value); // 7\n```\n\n...though if you find yourself writing code like that, consider using [classes](#Classes) instead.\n\n## Passing state across modules\n\nYou can declare state in `.svelte.js` and `.svelte.ts` files, but you can only _export_ that state if it's not directly reassigned. In other words you can't do this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = $state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\nThat's because every reference to `count` is transformed by the Svelte compiler — the code above is roughly equivalent to this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js (compiler output)\n// @filename: index.ts\ninterface Signal<T> {\n\tvalue: T;\n}\n\ninterface Svelte {\n\tstate<T>(value?: T): Signal<T>;\n\tget<T>(source: Signal<T>): T;\n\tset<T>(source: Signal<T>, value: T): void;\n}\ndeclare const $: Svelte;\n// ---cut---\nexport let count = $.state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\t$.set(count, $.get(count) + 1);\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] You can see the code Svelte generates by clicking the 'JS Output' tab in the [playground](/playground).\n\nSince the compiler only operates on one file at a time, if another file imports `count` Svelte doesn't know that it needs to wrap each reference in `$.get` and `$.set`:\n\n```js\n// @filename: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = 0;\n\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\nimport { count } from './state.svelte.js';\n\nconsole.log(typeof count); // 'object', not 'number'\n```\n\nThis leaves you with two options for sharing state between modules — either don't reassign it...\n\n```js\n// This is allowed — since we're updating\n// `counter.count` rather than `counter`,\n// Svelte doesn't wrap it in `$.state`\nexport const counter = $state({\n\tcount: 0\n});\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcounter.count += 1;\n}\n```\n\n...or don't directly export it:\n\n```js\nlet count = $state(0);\n\nexport function getCount() {\n\treturn count;\n}\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## basic-markup\n\nError: Section not found."

Include an increment button with the `data-testid=\"increment-button\"` attribute\n5. Display the current count with the `data-testid=\"count-value\"` attribute\n6. Clicking increment should increase the count by 1\n7. Clicking decrement should decrease the count by 1\n8. Style the counter with a CSS class \"counter\"\n\nExample structure:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"counter\">\n  <button data-testid=\"decrement-button\">-</button>\n  <span data-testid=\"count-value\">0</span>\n  <button data-testid=\"increment-button\">+</button>\n</div>\n```\n\nPlease implement this component using Svelte 5 syntax.

                              "text": "## $state\n\nThe `$state` rune allows you to create _reactive state_, which means that your UI _reacts_ when it changes.\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet count = $state(0);\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => count++}>\n\tclicks: {count}\n</button>\n```\n\nUnlike other frameworks you may have encountered, there is no API for interacting with state — `count` is just a number, rather than an object or a function, and you can update it like you would update any other variable.\n\n### Deep state\n\nIf `$state` is used with an array or a simple object, the result is a deeply reactive _state proxy_. [Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) allow Svelte to run code when you read or write properties, including via methods like `array.push(...)`, triggering granular updates.\n\nState is proxified recursively until Svelte finds something other than an array or simple object (like a class or an object created with `Object.create`). In a case like this...\n\n```js\nlet todos = $state([\n\t{\n\t\tdone: false,\n\t\ttext: 'add more todos'\n\t}\n]);\n```\n\n...modifying an individual todo's property will trigger updates to anything in your UI that depends on that specific property:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\nIf you push a new object to the array, it will also be proxified:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos.push({\n\tdone: false,\n\ttext: 'eat lunch'\n});\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] When you update properties of proxies, the original object is _not_ mutated. If you need to use your own proxy handlers in a state proxy, [you should wrap the object _after_ wrapping it in `$state`](https://svelte.dev/playground/hello-world?version=latest#H4sIAAAAAAAACpWR3WoDIRCFX2UqhWyIJL3erAulL9C7XnQLMe5ksbUqOpsfln33YuyGFNJC8UKdc2bOhw7Myk9kJXsJ0nttO9jcR5KEG9AWJDwHdzwxznbaYGTl68Do5JM_FRifuh-9X8Y9Gkq1rYx4q66cJbQUWcmqqIL2VDe2IYMEbvuOikBADi-GJDSkXG-phId0G-frye2DO2psQYDFQ0Ys8gQO350dUkEydEg82T0GOs0nsSG9g2IqgxACZueo2ZUlpdvoDC6N64qsg1QKY8T2bpZp8gpIfbCQ85Zn50Ud82HkeY83uDjspenxv3jXcSDyjPWf9L1vJf0GH666J-jLu1ery4dV257IWXBWGa0-xFDMQdTTn2ScxWKsn86ROsLwQxqrVR5QM84Ij8TKFD2-cUZSm4O2LSt30kQcvwCgCmfZnAIAAA==).\n\nNote that if you destructure a reactive value, the references are not reactive — as in normal JavaScript, they are evaluated at the point of destructuring:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\nlet { done, text } = todos[0];\n\n// this will not affect the value of `done`\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\n### Classes\n\nClass instances are not proxied. Instead, you can use `$state` in class fields (whether public or private), or as the first assignment to a property immediately inside the `constructor`:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\treset() {\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] The compiler transforms `done` and `text` into `get`/`set` methods on the class prototype referencing private fields. This means the properties are not enumerable.\n\nWhen calling methods in JavaScript, the value of [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) matters. This won't work, because `this` inside the `reset` method will be the `<button>` rather than the `Todo`:\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick={todo.reset}>\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\nYou can either use an inline function...\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick=+++{() => todo.reset()}>+++\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\n...or use an arrow function in the class definition:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\t+++reset = () => {+++\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Built-in classes\n\nSvelte provides reactive implementations of built-in classes like `Set`, `Map`, `Date` and `URL` that can be imported from [`svelte/reactivity`](svelte-reactivity).\n\n## `$state.raw`\n\nIn cases where you don't want objects and arrays to be deeply reactive you can use `$state.raw`.\n\nState declared with `$state.raw` cannot be mutated; it can only be _reassigned_. In other words, rather than assigning to a property of an object, or using an array method like `push`, replace the object or array altogether if you'd like to update it:\n\n```js\nlet person = $state.raw({\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 49\n});\n\n// this will have no effect\nperson.age += 1;\n\n// this will work, because we're creating a new person\nperson = {\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 50\n};\n```\n\nThis can improve performance with large arrays and objects that you weren't planning to mutate anyway, since it avoids the cost of making them reactive. Note that raw state can _contain_ reactive state (for example, a raw array of reactive objects).\n\nAs with `$state`, you can declare class fields using `$state.raw`.\n\n## `$state.snapshot`\n\nTo take a static snapshot of a deeply reactive `$state` proxy, use `$state.snapshot`:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet counter = $state({ count: 0 });\n\n\tfunction onclick() {\n\t\t// Will log `{ count: ... }` rather than `Proxy { ... }`\n\t\tconsole.log($state.snapshot(counter));\n\t}\n</script>\n```\n\nThis is handy when you want to pass some state to an external library or API that doesn't expect a proxy, such as `structuredClone`.\n\n## `$state.eager`\n\nWhen state changes, it may not be reflected in the UI immediately if it is used by an `await` expression, because [updates are synchronized](await-expressions#Synchronized-updates).\n\nIn some cases, you may want to update the UI as soon as the state changes. For example, you might want to update a navigation bar when the user clicks on a link, so that they get visual feedback while waiting for the new page to load. To do this, use `$state.eager(value)`:\n\n```svelte\n<nav>\n\t<a href=\"/\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/' ? 'page' : null}>home</a>\n\t<a href=\"/about\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/about' ? 'page' : null}>about</a>\n</nav>\n```\n\nUse this feature sparingly, and only to provide feedback in response to user action — in general, allowing Svelte to coordinate updates will provide a better user experience.\n\n## Passing state into functions\n\nJavaScript is a _pass-by-value_ language — when you call a function, the arguments are the _values_ rather than the _variables_. In other words:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {number} a\n * @param {number} b\n */\nfunction add(a, b) {\n\treturn a + b;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add(a, b);\nconsole.log(total); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(total); // still 3!\n```\n\nIf `add` wanted to have access to the _current_ values of `a` and `b`, and to return the current `total` value, you would need to use functions instead:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {() => number} getA\n * @param {() => number} getB\n */\nfunction add(+++getA, getB+++) {\n\treturn +++() => getA() + getB()+++;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add+++(() => a, () => b)+++;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 7\n```\n\nState in Svelte is no different — when you reference something declared with the `$state` rune...\n\n```js\nlet a = +++$state(1)+++;\nlet b = +++$state(2)+++;\n```\n\n...you're accessing its _current value_.\n\nNote that 'functions' is broad — it encompasses properties of proxies and [`get`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get)/[`set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) properties...\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {{ a: number, b: number }} input\n */\nfunction add(input) {\n\treturn {\n\t\tget value() {\n\t\t\treturn input.a + input.b;\n\t\t}\n\t};\n}\n\nlet input = $state({ a: 1, b: 2 });\nlet total = add(input);\nconsole.log(total.value); // 3\n\ninput.a = 3;\ninput.b = 4;\nconsole.log(total.value); // 7\n```\n\n...though if you find yourself writing code like that, consider using [classes](#Classes) instead.\n\n## Passing state across modules\n\nYou can declare state in `.svelte.js` and `.svelte.ts` files, but you can only _export_ that state if it's not directly reassigned. In other words you can't do this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = $state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\nThat's because every reference to `count` is transformed by the Svelte compiler — the code above is roughly equivalent to this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js (compiler output)\n// @filename: index.ts\ninterface Signal<T> {\n\tvalue: T;\n}\n\ninterface Svelte {\n\tstate<T>(value?: T): Signal<T>;\n\tget<T>(source: Signal<T>): T;\n\tset<T>(source: Signal<T>, value: T): void;\n}\ndeclare const $: Svelte;\n// ---cut---\nexport let count = $.state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\t$.set(count, $.get(count) + 1);\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] You can see the code Svelte generates by clicking the 'JS Output' tab in the [playground](/playground).\n\nSince the compiler only operates on one file at a time, if another file imports `count` Svelte doesn't know that it needs to wrap each reference in `$.get` and `$.set`:\n\n```js\n// @filename: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = 0;\n\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\nimport { count } from './state.svelte.js';\n\nconsole.log(typeof count); // 'object', not 'number'\n```\n\nThis leaves you with two options for sharing state between modules — either don't reassign it...\n\n```js\n// This is allowed — since we're updating\n// `counter.count` rather than `counter`,\n// Svelte doesn't wrap it in `$.state`\nexport const counter = $state({\n\tcount: 0\n});\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcounter.count += 1;\n}\n```\n\n...or don't directly export it:\n\n```js\nlet count = $state(0);\n\nexport function getCount() {\n\treturn count;\n}\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## basic-markup\n\nError: Section not found."

                            "text": "## $state\n\nThe `$state` rune allows you to create _reactive state_, which means that your UI _reacts_ when it changes.\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet count = $state(0);\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => count++}>\n\tclicks: {count}\n</button>\n```\n\nUnlike other frameworks you may have encountered, there is no API for interacting with state — `count` is just a number, rather than an object or a function, and you can update it like you would update any other variable.\n\n### Deep state\n\nIf `$state` is used with an array or a simple object, the result is a deeply reactive _state proxy_. [Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) allow Svelte to run code when you read or write properties, including via methods like `array.push(...)`, triggering granular updates.\n\nState is proxified recursively until Svelte finds something other than an array or simple object (like a class or an object created with `Object.create`). In a case like this...\n\n```js\nlet todos = $state([\n\t{\n\t\tdone: false,\n\t\ttext: 'add more todos'\n\t}\n]);\n```\n\n...modifying an individual todo's property will trigger updates to anything in your UI that depends on that specific property:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\nIf you push a new object to the array, it will also be proxified:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos.push({\n\tdone: false,\n\ttext: 'eat lunch'\n});\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] When you update properties of proxies, the original object is _not_ mutated. If you need to use your own proxy handlers in a state proxy, [you should wrap the object _after_ wrapping it in `$state`](https://svelte.dev/playground/hello-world?version=latest#H4sIAAAAAAAACpWR3WoDIRCFX2UqhWyIJL3erAulL9C7XnQLMe5ksbUqOpsfln33YuyGFNJC8UKdc2bOhw7Myk9kJXsJ0nttO9jcR5KEG9AWJDwHdzwxznbaYGTl68Do5JM_FRifuh-9X8Y9Gkq1rYx4q66cJbQUWcmqqIL2VDe2IYMEbvuOikBADi-GJDSkXG-phId0G-frye2DO2psQYDFQ0Ys8gQO350dUkEydEg82T0GOs0nsSG9g2IqgxACZueo2ZUlpdvoDC6N64qsg1QKY8T2bpZp8gpIfbCQ85Zn50Ud82HkeY83uDjspenxv3jXcSDyjPWf9L1vJf0GH666J-jLu1ery4dV257IWXBWGa0-xFDMQdTTn2ScxWKsn86ROsLwQxqrVR5QM84Ij8TKFD2-cUZSm4O2LSt30kQcvwCgCmfZnAIAAA==).\n\nNote that if you destructure a reactive value, the references are not reactive — as in normal JavaScript, they are evaluated at the point of destructuring:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\nlet { done, text } = todos[0];\n\n// this will not affect the value of `done`\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\n### Classes\n\nClass instances are not proxied. Instead, you can use `$state` in class fields (whether public or private), or as the first assignment to a property immediately inside the `constructor`:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\treset() {\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] The compiler transforms `done` and `text` into `get`/`set` methods on the class prototype referencing private fields. This means the properties are not enumerable.\n\nWhen calling methods in JavaScript, the value of [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) matters. This won't work, because `this` inside the `reset` method will be the `<button>` rather than the `Todo`:\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick={todo.reset}>\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\nYou can either use an inline function...\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick=+++{() => todo.reset()}>+++\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\n...or use an arrow function in the class definition:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\t+++reset = () => {+++\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Built-in classes\n\nSvelte provides reactive implementations of built-in classes like `Set`, `Map`, `Date` and `URL` that can be imported from [`svelte/reactivity`](svelte-reactivity).\n\n## `$state.raw`\n\nIn cases where you don't want objects and arrays to be deeply reactive you can use `$state.raw`.\n\nState declared with `$state.raw` cannot be mutated; it can only be _reassigned_. In other words, rather than assigning to a property of an object, or using an array method like `push`, replace the object or array altogether if you'd like to update it:\n\n```js\nlet person = $state.raw({\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 49\n});\n\n// this will have no effect\nperson.age += 1;\n\n// this will work, because we're creating a new person\nperson = {\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 50\n};\n```\n\nThis can improve performance with large arrays and objects that you weren't planning to mutate anyway, since it avoids the cost of making them reactive. Note that raw state can _contain_ reactive state (for example, a raw array of reactive objects).\n\nAs with `$state`, you can declare class fields using `$state.raw`.\n\n## `$state.snapshot`\n\nTo take a static snapshot of a deeply reactive `$state` proxy, use `$state.snapshot`:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet counter = $state({ count: 0 });\n\n\tfunction onclick() {\n\t\t// Will log `{ count: ... }` rather than `Proxy { ... }`\n\t\tconsole.log($state.snapshot(counter));\n\t}\n</script>\n```\n\nThis is handy when you want to pass some state to an external library or API that doesn't expect a proxy, such as `structuredClone`.\n\n## `$state.eager`\n\nWhen state changes, it may not be reflected in the UI immediately if it is used by an `await` expression, because [updates are synchronized](await-expressions#Synchronized-updates).\n\nIn some cases, you may want to update the UI as soon as the state changes. For example, you might want to update a navigation bar when the user clicks on a link, so that they get visual feedback while waiting for the new page to load. To do this, use `$state.eager(value)`:\n\n```svelte\n<nav>\n\t<a href=\"/\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/' ? 'page' : null}>home</a>\n\t<a href=\"/about\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/about' ? 'page' : null}>about</a>\n</nav>\n```\n\nUse this feature sparingly, and only to provide feedback in response to user action — in general, allowing Svelte to coordinate updates will provide a better user experience.\n\n## Passing state into functions\n\nJavaScript is a _pass-by-value_ language — when you call a function, the arguments are the _values_ rather than the _variables_. In other words:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {number} a\n * @param {number} b\n */\nfunction add(a, b) {\n\treturn a + b;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add(a, b);\nconsole.log(total); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(total); // still 3!\n```\n\nIf `add` wanted to have access to the _current_ values of `a` and `b`, and to return the current `total` value, you would need to use functions instead:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {() => number} getA\n * @param {() => number} getB\n */\nfunction add(+++getA, getB+++) {\n\treturn +++() => getA() + getB()+++;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add+++(() => a, () => b)+++;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 7\n```\n\nState in Svelte is no different — when you reference something declared with the `$state` rune...\n\n```js\nlet a = +++$state(1)+++;\nlet b = +++$state(2)+++;\n```\n\n...you're accessing its _current value_.\n\nNote that 'functions' is broad — it encompasses properties of proxies and [`get`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get)/[`set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) properties...\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {{ a: number, b: number }} input\n */\nfunction add(input) {\n\treturn {\n\t\tget value() {\n\t\t\treturn input.a + input.b;\n\t\t}\n\t};\n}\n\nlet input = $state({ a: 1, b: 2 });\nlet total = add(input);\nconsole.log(total.value); // 3\n\ninput.a = 3;\ninput.b = 4;\nconsole.log(total.value); // 7\n```\n\n...though if you find yourself writing code like that, consider using [classes](#Classes) instead.\n\n## Passing state across modules\n\nYou can declare state in `.svelte.js` and `.svelte.ts` files, but you can only _export_ that state if it's not directly reassigned. In other words you can't do this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = $state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\nThat's because every reference to `count` is transformed by the Svelte compiler — the code above is roughly equivalent to this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js (compiler output)\n// @filename: index.ts\ninterface Signal<T> {\n\tvalue: T;\n}\n\ninterface Svelte {\n\tstate<T>(value?: T): Signal<T>;\n\tget<T>(source: Signal<T>): T;\n\tset<T>(source: Signal<T>, value: T): void;\n}\ndeclare const $: Svelte;\n// ---cut---\nexport let count = $.state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\t$.set(count, $.get(count) + 1);\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] You can see the code Svelte generates by clicking the 'JS Output' tab in the [playground](/playground).\n\nSince the compiler only operates on one file at a time, if another file imports `count` Svelte doesn't know that it needs to wrap each reference in `$.get` and `$.set`:\n\n```js\n// @filename: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = 0;\n\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\nimport { count } from './state.svelte.js';\n\nconsole.log(typeof count); // 'object', not 'number'\n```\n\nThis leaves you with two options for sharing state between modules — either don't reassign it...\n\n```js\n// This is allowed — since we're updating\n// `counter.count` rather than `counter`,\n// Svelte doesn't wrap it in `$.state`\nexport const counter = $state({\n\tcount: 0\n});\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcounter.count += 1;\n}\n```\n\n...or don't directly export it:\n\n```js\nlet count = $state(0);\n\nexport function getCount() {\n\treturn count;\n}\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## basic-markup\n\nError: Section not found."

[Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) allow Svelte to run code when you read or write properties, including via methods like `array.push(...)`, triggering granular updates.\n\nState is proxified recursively until Svelte finds something other than an array or simple object (like a class or an object created with `Object.create`). In a case like this...\n\n```js\nlet todos = $state([\n\t{\n\t\tdone: false,\n\t\ttext: 'add more todos'\n\t}\n]);\n```\n\n...modifying an individual todo's property will trigger updates to anything in your UI that depends on that specific property:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\nIf you push a new object to the array, it will also be proxified:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos.push({\n\tdone: false,\n\ttext: 'eat lunch'\n});\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] When you update properties of proxies, the original object is _not_ mutated. If you need to use your own proxy handlers in a state proxy, [you should wrap the object _after_ wrapping it in `$state`](https://svelte.dev/playground/hello-world?version=latest#H4sIAAAAAAAACpWR3WoDIRCFX2UqhWyIJL3erAulL9C7XnQLMe5ksbUqOpsfln33YuyGFNJC8UKdc2bOhw7Myk9kJXsJ0nttO9jcR5KEG9AWJDwHdzwxznbaYGTl68Do5JM_FRifuh-9X8Y9Gkq1rYx4q66cJbQUWcmqqIL2VDe2IYMEbvuOikBADi-GJDSkXG-phId0G-frye2DO2psQYDFQ0Ys8gQO350dUkEydEg82T0GOs0nsSG9g2IqgxACZueo2ZUlpdvoDC6N64qsg1QKY8T2bpZp8gpIfbCQ85Zn50Ud82HkeY83uDjspenxv3jXcSDyjPWf9L1vJf0GH666J-jLu1ery4dV257IWXBWGa0-xFDMQdTTn2ScxWKsn86ROsLwQxqrVR5QM84Ij8TKFD2-cUZSm4O2LSt30kQcvwCgCmfZnAIAAA==).\n\nNote that if you destructure a reactive value, the references are not reactive — as in normal JavaScript, they are evaluated at the point of destructuring:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\nlet { done, text } = todos[0];\n\n// this will not affect the value of `done`\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\n### Classes\n\nClass instances are not proxied. Instead, you can use `$state` in class fields (whether public or private), or as the first assignment to a property immediately inside the `constructor`:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\treset() {\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] The compiler transforms `done` and `text` into `get`/`set` methods on the class prototype referencing private fields. This means the properties are not enumerable.\n\nWhen calling methods in JavaScript, the value of [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) matters. This won't work, because `this` inside the `reset` method will be the `<button>` rather than the `Todo`:\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick={todo.reset}>\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\nYou can either use an inline function...\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick=+++{() => todo.reset()}>+++\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\n...or use an arrow function in the class definition:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\t+++reset = () => {+++\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Built-in classes\n\nSvelte provides reactive implementations of built-in classes like `Set`, `Map`, `Date` and `URL` that can be imported from [`svelte/reactivity`](svelte-reactivity).\n\n## `$state.raw`\n\nIn cases where you don't want objects and arrays to be deeply reactive you can use `$state.raw`.\n\nState declared with `$state.raw` cannot be mutated; it can only be _reassigned_. In other words, rather than assigning to a property of an object, or using an array method like `push`, replace the object or array altogether if you'd like to update it:\n\n```js\nlet person = $state.raw({\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 49\n});\n\n// this will have no effect\nperson.age += 1;\n\n// this will work, because we're creating a new person\nperson = {\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 50\n};\n```\n\nThis can improve performance with large arrays and objects that you weren't planning to mutate anyway, since it avoids the cost of making them reactive. Note that raw state can _contain_ reactive state (for example, a raw array of reactive objects).\n\nAs with `$state`, you can declare class fields using `$state.raw`.\n\n## `$state.snapshot`\n\nTo take a static snapshot of a deeply reactive `$state` proxy, use `$state.snapshot`:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet counter = $state({ count: 0 });\n\n\tfunction onclick() {\n\t\t// Will log `{ count: ... }` rather than `Proxy { ... }`\n\t\tconsole.log($state.snapshot(counter));\n\t}\n</script>\n```\n\nThis is handy when you want to pass some state to an external library or API that doesn't expect a proxy, such as `structuredClone`.\n\n## `$state.eager`\n\nWhen state changes, it may not be reflected in the UI immediately if it is used by an `await` expression, because [updates are synchronized](await-expressions#Synchronized-updates).\n\nIn some cases, you may want to update the UI as soon as the state changes. For example, you might want to update a navigation bar when the user clicks on a link, so that they get visual feedback while waiting for the new page to load. To do this, use `$state.eager(value)`:\n\n```svelte\n<nav>\n\t<a href=\"/\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/' ? 'page' : null}>home</a>\n\t<a href=\"/about\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/about' ? 'page' : null}>about</a>\n</nav>\n```\n\nUse this feature sparingly, and only to provide feedback in response to user action — in general, allowing Svelte to coordinate updates will provide a better user experience.\n\n## Passing state into functions\n\nJavaScript is a _pass-by-value_ language — when you call a function, the arguments are the _values_ rather than the _variables_. In other words:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {number} a\n * @param {number} b\n */\nfunction add(a, b) {\n\treturn a + b;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add(a, b);\nconsole.log(total); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(total); // still 3!\n```\n\nIf `add` wanted to have access to the _current_ values of `a` and `b`, and to return the current `total` value, you would need to use functions instead:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {() => number} getA\n * @param {() => number} getB\n */\nfunction add(+++getA, getB+++) {\n\treturn +++() => getA() + getB()+++;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add+++(() => a, () => b)+++;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 7\n```\n\nState in Svelte is no different — when you reference something declared with the `$state` rune...\n\n```js\nlet a = +++$state(1)+++;\nlet b = +++$state(2)+++;\n```\n\n...you're accessing its _current value_.\n\nNote that 'functions' is broad — it encompasses properties of proxies and [`get`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get)/[`set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) properties...\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {{ a: number, b: number }} input\n */\nfunction add(input) {\n\treturn {\n\t\tget value() {\n\t\t\treturn input.a + input.b;\n\t\t}\n\t};\n}\n\nlet input = $state({ a: 1, b: 2 });\nlet total = add(input);\nconsole.log(total.value); // 3\n\ninput.a = 3;\ninput.b = 4;\nconsole.log(total.value); // 7\n```\n\n...though if you find yourself writing code like that, consider using [classes](#Classes) instead.\n\n## Passing state across modules\n\nYou can declare state in `.svelte.js` and `.svelte.ts` files, but you can only _export_ that state if it's not directly reassigned. In other words you can't do this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = $state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\nThat's because every reference to `count` is transformed by the Svelte compiler — the code above is roughly equivalent to this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js (compiler output)\n// @filename: index.ts\ninterface Signal<T> {\n\tvalue: T;\n}\n\ninterface Svelte {\n\tstate<T>(value?: T): Signal<T>;\n\tget<T>(source: Signal<T>): T;\n\tset<T>(source: Signal<T>, value: T): void;\n}\ndeclare const $: Svelte;\n// ---cut---\nexport let count = $.state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\t$.set(count, $.get(count) + 1);\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] You can see the code Svelte generates by clicking the 'JS Output' tab in the [playground](/playground).\n\nSince the compiler only operates on one file at a time, if another file imports `count` Svelte doesn't know that it needs to wrap each reference in `$.get` and `$.set`:\n\n```js\n// @filename: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = 0;\n\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\nimport { count } from './state.svelte.js';\n\nconsole.log(typeof count); // 'object', not 'number'\n```\n\nThis leaves you with two options for sharing state between modules — either don't reassign it...\n\n```js\n// This is allowed — since we're updating\n// `counter.count` rather than `counter`,\n// Svelte doesn't wrap it in `$.state`\nexport const counter = $state({\n\tcount: 0\n});\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcounter.count += 1;\n}\n```\n\n...or don't directly export it:\n\n```js\nlet count = $state(0);\n\nexport function getCount() {\n\treturn count;\n}\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## basic-markup\n\nError: Section not found."

                            "text": "## $state\n\nThe `$state` rune allows you to create _reactive state_, which means that your UI _reacts_ when it changes.\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet count = $state(0);\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => count++}>\n\tclicks: {count}\n</button>\n```\n\nUnlike other frameworks you may have encountered, there is no API for interacting with state — `count` is just a number, rather than an object or a function, and you can update it like you would update any other variable.\n\n### Deep state\n\nIf `$state` is used with an array or a simple object, the result is a deeply reactive _state proxy_. [Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) allow Svelte to run code when you read or write properties, including via methods like `array.push(...)`, triggering granular updates.\n\nState is proxified recursively until Svelte finds something other than an array or simple object (like a class or an object created with `Object.create`). In a case like this...\n\n```js\nlet todos = $state([\n\t{\n\t\tdone: false,\n\t\ttext: 'add more todos'\n\t}\n]);\n```\n\n...modifying an individual todo's property will trigger updates to anything in your UI that depends on that specific property:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\nIf you push a new object to the array, it will also be proxified:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos.push({\n\tdone: false,\n\ttext: 'eat lunch'\n});\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] When you update properties of proxies, the original object is _not_ mutated. If you need to use your own proxy handlers in a state proxy, [you should wrap the object _after_ wrapping it in `$state`](https://svelte.dev/playground/hello-world?version=latest#H4sIAAAAAAAACpWR3WoDIRCFX2UqhWyIJL3erAulL9C7XnQLMe5ksbUqOpsfln33YuyGFNJC8UKdc2bOhw7Myk9kJXsJ0nttO9jcR5KEG9AWJDwHdzwxznbaYGTl68Do5JM_FRifuh-9X8Y9Gkq1rYx4q66cJbQUWcmqqIL2VDe2IYMEbvuOikBADi-GJDSkXG-phId0G-frye2DO2psQYDFQ0Ys8gQO350dUkEydEg82T0GOs0nsSG9g2IqgxACZueo2ZUlpdvoDC6N64qsg1QKY8T2bpZp8gpIfbCQ85Zn50Ud82HkeY83uDjspenxv3jXcSDyjPWf9L1vJf0GH666J-jLu1ery4dV257IWXBWGa0-xFDMQdTTn2ScxWKsn86ROsLwQxqrVR5QM84Ij8TKFD2-cUZSm4O2LSt30kQcvwCgCmfZnAIAAA==).\n\nNote that if you destructure a reactive value, the references are not reactive — as in normal JavaScript, they are evaluated at the point of destructuring:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\nlet { done, text } = todos[0];\n\n// this will not affect the value of `done`\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\n### Classes\n\nClass instances are not proxied. Instead, you can use `$state` in class fields (whether public or private), or as the first assignment to a property immediately inside the `constructor`:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\treset() {\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] The compiler transforms `done` and `text` into `get`/`set` methods on the class prototype referencing private fields. This means the properties are not enumerable.\n\nWhen calling methods in JavaScript, the value of [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) matters. This won't work, because `this` inside the `reset` method will be the `<button>` rather than the `Todo`:\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick={todo.reset}>\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\nYou can either use an inline function...\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick=+++{() => todo.reset()}>+++\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\n...or use an arrow function in the class definition:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\t+++reset = () => {+++\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Built-in classes\n\nSvelte provides reactive implementations of built-in classes like `Set`, `Map`, `Date` and `URL` that can be imported from [`svelte/reactivity`](svelte-reactivity).\n\n## `$state.raw`\n\nIn cases where you don't want objects and arrays to be deeply reactive you can use `$state.raw`.\n\nState declared with `$state.raw` cannot be mutated; it can only be _reassigned_. In other words, rather than assigning to a property of an object, or using an array method like `push`, replace the object or array altogether if you'd like to update it:\n\n```js\nlet person = $state.raw({\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 49\n});\n\n// this will have no effect\nperson.age += 1;\n\n// this will work, because we're creating a new person\nperson = {\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 50\n};\n```\n\nThis can improve performance with large arrays and objects that you weren't planning to mutate anyway, since it avoids the cost of making them reactive. Note that raw state can _contain_ reactive state (for example, a raw array of reactive objects).\n\nAs with `$state`, you can declare class fields using `$state.raw`.\n\n## `$state.snapshot`\n\nTo take a static snapshot of a deeply reactive `$state` proxy, use `$state.snapshot`:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet counter = $state({ count: 0 });\n\n\tfunction onclick() {\n\t\t// Will log `{ count: ... }` rather than `Proxy { ... }`\n\t\tconsole.log($state.snapshot(counter));\n\t}\n</script>\n```\n\nThis is handy when you want to pass some state to an external library or API that doesn't expect a proxy, such as `structuredClone`.\n\n## `$state.eager`\n\nWhen state changes, it may not be reflected in the UI immediately if it is used by an `await` expression, because [updates are synchronized](await-expressions#Synchronized-updates).\n\nIn some cases, you may want to update the UI as soon as the state changes. For example, you might want to update a navigation bar when the user clicks on a link, so that they get visual feedback while waiting for the new page to load. To do this, use `$state.eager(value)`:\n\n```svelte\n<nav>\n\t<a href=\"/\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/' ? 'page' : null}>home</a>\n\t<a href=\"/about\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/about' ? 'page' : null}>about</a>\n</nav>\n```\n\nUse this feature sparingly, and only to provide feedback in response to user action — in general, allowing Svelte to coordinate updates will provide a better user experience.\n\n## Passing state into functions\n\nJavaScript is a _pass-by-value_ language — when you call a function, the arguments are the _values_ rather than the _variables_. In other words:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {number} a\n * @param {number} b\n */\nfunction add(a, b) {\n\treturn a + b;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add(a, b);\nconsole.log(total); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(total); // still 3!\n```\n\nIf `add` wanted to have access to the _current_ values of `a` and `b`, and to return the current `total` value, you would need to use functions instead:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {() => number} getA\n * @param {() => number} getB\n */\nfunction add(+++getA, getB+++) {\n\treturn +++() => getA() + getB()+++;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add+++(() => a, () => b)+++;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 7\n```\n\nState in Svelte is no different — when you reference something declared with the `$state` rune...\n\n```js\nlet a = +++$state(1)+++;\nlet b = +++$state(2)+++;\n```\n\n...you're accessing its _current value_.\n\nNote that 'functions' is broad — it encompasses properties of proxies and [`get`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get)/[`set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) properties...\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {{ a: number, b: number }} input\n */\nfunction add(input) {\n\treturn {\n\t\tget value() {\n\t\t\treturn input.a + input.b;\n\t\t}\n\t};\n}\n\nlet input = $state({ a: 1, b: 2 });\nlet total = add(input);\nconsole.log(total.value); // 3\n\ninput.a = 3;\ninput.b = 4;\nconsole.log(total.value); // 7\n```\n\n...though if you find yourself writing code like that, consider using [classes](#Classes) instead.\n\n## Passing state across modules\n\nYou can declare state in `.svelte.js` and `.svelte.ts` files, but you can only _export_ that state if it's not directly reassigned. In other words you can't do this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = $state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\nThat's because every reference to `count` is transformed by the Svelte compiler — the code above is roughly equivalent to this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js (compiler output)\n// @filename: index.ts\ninterface Signal<T> {\n\tvalue: T;\n}\n\ninterface Svelte {\n\tstate<T>(value?: T): Signal<T>;\n\tget<T>(source: Signal<T>): T;\n\tset<T>(source: Signal<T>, value: T): void;\n}\ndeclare const $: Svelte;\n// ---cut---\nexport let count = $.state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\t$.set(count, $.get(count) + 1);\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] You can see the code Svelte generates by clicking the 'JS Output' tab in the [playground](/playground).\n\nSince the compiler only operates on one file at a time, if another file imports `count` Svelte doesn't know that it needs to wrap each reference in `$.get` and `$.set`:\n\n```js\n// @filename: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = 0;\n\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\nimport { count } from './state.svelte.js';\n\nconsole.log(typeof count); // 'object', not 'number'\n```\n\nThis leaves you with two options for sharing state between modules — either don't reassign it...\n\n```js\n// This is allowed — since we're updating\n// `counter.count` rather than `counter`,\n// Svelte doesn't wrap it in `$.state`\nexport const counter = $state({\n\tcount: 0\n});\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcounter.count += 1;\n}\n```\n\n...or don't directly export it:\n\n```js\nlet count = $state(0);\n\nexport function getCount() {\n\treturn count;\n}\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## basic-markup\n\nError: Section not found."

Use Svelte 5's `$state` for reactivity\n2. The counter should start at 0\n3. Include a decrement button with the `data-testid=\"decrement-button\"` attribute\n4. Include an increment button with the `data-testid=\"increment-button\"` attribute\n5. Display the current count with the `data-testid=\"count-value\"` attribute\n6. Clicking increment should increase the count by 1\n7. Clicking decrement should decrease the count by 1\n8. Style the counter with a CSS class \"counter\"\n\nExample structure:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"counter\">\n  <button data-testid=\"decrement-button\">-</button>\n  <span data-testid=\"count-value\">0</span>\n  <button data-testid=\"increment-button\">+</button>\n</div>\n```\n\nPlease implement this component using Svelte 5 syntax. Make sure you only return one component.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: When you have finished implementing the component, use the ResultWrite tool to output your final Svelte component code. Only output the component code itself, no explanations or markdown formatting."

                              "text": "## $state\n\nThe `$state` rune allows you to create _reactive state_, which means that your UI _reacts_ when it changes.\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet count = $state(0);\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => count++}>\n\tclicks: {count}\n</button>\n```\n\nUnlike other frameworks you may have encountered, there is no API for interacting with state — `count` is just a number, rather than an object or a function, and you can update it like you would update any other variable.\n\n### Deep state\n\nIf `$state` is used with an array or a simple object, the result is a deeply reactive _state proxy_. [Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) allow Svelte to run code when you read or write properties, including via methods like `array.push(...)`, triggering granular updates.\n\nState is proxified recursively until Svelte finds something other than an array or simple object (like a class or an object created with `Object.create`). In a case like this...\n\n```js\nlet todos = $state([\n\t{\n\t\tdone: false,\n\t\ttext: 'add more todos'\n\t}\n]);\n```\n\n...modifying an individual todo's property will trigger updates to anything in your UI that depends on that specific property:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\nIf you push a new object to the array, it will also be proxified:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos.push({\n\tdone: false,\n\ttext: 'eat lunch'\n});\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] When you update properties of proxies, the original object is _not_ mutated. If you need to use your own proxy handlers in a state proxy, [you should wrap the object _after_ wrapping it in `$state`](https://svelte.dev/playground/hello-world?version=latest#H4sIAAAAAAAACpWR3WoDIRCFX2UqhWyIJL3erAulL9C7XnQLMe5ksbUqOpsfln33YuyGFNJC8UKdc2bOhw7Myk9kJXsJ0nttO9jcR5KEG9AWJDwHdzwxznbaYGTl68Do5JM_FRifuh-9X8Y9Gkq1rYx4q66cJbQUWcmqqIL2VDe2IYMEbvuOikBADi-GJDSkXG-phId0G-frye2DO2psQYDFQ0Ys8gQO350dUkEydEg82T0GOs0nsSG9g2IqgxACZueo2ZUlpdvoDC6N64qsg1QKY8T2bpZp8gpIfbCQ85Zn50Ud82HkeY83uDjspenxv3jXcSDyjPWf9L1vJf0GH666J-jLu1ery4dV257IWXBWGa0-xFDMQdTTn2ScxWKsn86ROsLwQxqrVR5QM84Ij8TKFD2-cUZSm4O2LSt30kQcvwCgCmfZnAIAAA==).\n\nNote that if you destructure a reactive value, the references are not reactive — as in normal JavaScript, they are evaluated at the point of destructuring:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\nlet { done, text } = todos[0];\n\n// this will not affect the value of `done`\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\n### Classes\n\nClass instances are not proxied. Instead, you can use `$state` in class fields (whether public or private), or as the first assignment to a property immediately inside the `constructor`:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\treset() {\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] The compiler transforms `done` and `text` into `get`/`set` methods on the class prototype referencing private fields. This means the properties are not enumerable.\n\nWhen calling methods in JavaScript, the value of [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) matters. This won't work, because `this` inside the `reset` method will be the `<button>` rather than the `Todo`:\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick={todo.reset}>\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\nYou can either use an inline function...\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick=+++{() => todo.reset()}>+++\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\n...or use an arrow function in the class definition:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\t+++reset = () => {+++\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Built-in classes\n\nSvelte provides reactive implementations of built-in classes like `Set`, `Map`, `Date` and `URL` that can be imported from [`svelte/reactivity`](svelte-reactivity).\n\n## `$state.raw`\n\nIn cases where you don't want objects and arrays to be deeply reactive you can use `$state.raw`.\n\nState declared with `$state.raw` cannot be mutated; it can only be _reassigned_. In other words, rather than assigning to a property of an object, or using an array method like `push`, replace the object or array altogether if you'd like to update it:\n\n```js\nlet person = $state.raw({\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 49\n});\n\n// this will have no effect\nperson.age += 1;\n\n// this will work, because we're creating a new person\nperson = {\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 50\n};\n```\n\nThis can improve performance with large arrays and objects that you weren't planning to mutate anyway, since it avoids the cost of making them reactive. Note that raw state can _contain_ reactive state (for example, a raw array of reactive objects).\n\nAs with `$state`, you can declare class fields using `$state.raw`.\n\n## `$state.snapshot`\n\nTo take a static snapshot of a deeply reactive `$state` proxy, use `$state.snapshot`:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet counter = $state({ count: 0 });\n\n\tfunction onclick() {\n\t\t// Will log `{ count: ... }` rather than `Proxy { ... }`\n\t\tconsole.log($state.snapshot(counter));\n\t}\n</script>\n```\n\nThis is handy when you want to pass some state to an external library or API that doesn't expect a proxy, such as `structuredClone`.\n\n## `$state.eager`\n\nWhen state changes, it may not be reflected in the UI immediately if it is used by an `await` expression, because [updates are synchronized](await-expressions#Synchronized-updates).\n\nIn some cases, you may want to update the UI as soon as the state changes. For example, you might want to update a navigation bar when the user clicks on a link, so that they get visual feedback while waiting for the new page to load. To do this, use `$state.eager(value)`:\n\n```svelte\n<nav>\n\t<a href=\"/\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/' ? 'page' : null}>home</a>\n\t<a href=\"/about\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/about' ? 'page' : null}>about</a>\n</nav>\n```\n\nUse this feature sparingly, and only to provide feedback in response to user action — in general, allowing Svelte to coordinate updates will provide a better user experience.\n\n## Passing state into functions\n\nJavaScript is a _pass-by-value_ language — when you call a function, the arguments are the _values_ rather than the _variables_. In other words:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {number} a\n * @param {number} b\n */\nfunction add(a, b) {\n\treturn a + b;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add(a, b);\nconsole.log(total); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(total); // still 3!\n```\n\nIf `add` wanted to have access to the _current_ values of `a` and `b`, and to return the current `total` value, you would need to use functions instead:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {() => number} getA\n * @param {() => number} getB\n */\nfunction add(+++getA, getB+++) {\n\treturn +++() => getA() + getB()+++;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add+++(() => a, () => b)+++;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 7\n```\n\nState in Svelte is no different — when you reference something declared with the `$state` rune...\n\n```js\nlet a = +++$state(1)+++;\nlet b = +++$state(2)+++;\n```\n\n...you're accessing its _current value_.\n\nNote that 'functions' is broad — it encompasses properties of proxies and [`get`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get)/[`set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) properties...\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {{ a: number, b: number }} input\n */\nfunction add(input) {\n\treturn {\n\t\tget value() {\n\t\t\treturn input.a + input.b;\n\t\t}\n\t};\n}\n\nlet input = $state({ a: 1, b: 2 });\nlet total = add(input);\nconsole.log(total.value); // 3\n\ninput.a = 3;\ninput.b = 4;\nconsole.log(total.value); // 7\n```\n\n...though if you find yourself writing code like that, consider using [classes](#Classes) instead.\n\n## Passing state across modules\n\nYou can declare state in `.svelte.js` and `.svelte.ts` files, but you can only _export_ that state if it's not directly reassigned. In other words you can't do this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = $state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\nThat's because every reference to `count` is transformed by the Svelte compiler — the code above is roughly equivalent to this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js (compiler output)\n// @filename: index.ts\ninterface Signal<T> {\n\tvalue: T;\n}\n\ninterface Svelte {\n\tstate<T>(value?: T): Signal<T>;\n\tget<T>(source: Signal<T>): T;\n\tset<T>(source: Signal<T>, value: T): void;\n}\ndeclare const $: Svelte;\n// ---cut---\nexport let count = $.state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\t$.set(count, $.get(count) + 1);\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] You can see the code Svelte generates by clicking the 'JS Output' tab in the [playground](/playground).\n\nSince the compiler only operates on one file at a time, if another file imports `count` Svelte doesn't know that it needs to wrap each reference in `$.get` and `$.set`:\n\n```js\n// @filename: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = 0;\n\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\nimport { count } from './state.svelte.js';\n\nconsole.log(typeof count); // 'object', not 'number'\n```\n\nThis leaves you with two options for sharing state between modules — either don't reassign it...\n\n```js\n// This is allowed — since we're updating\n// `counter.count` rather than `counter`,\n// Svelte doesn't wrap it in `$.state`\nexport const counter = $state({\n\tcount: 0\n});\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcounter.count += 1;\n}\n```\n\n...or don't directly export it:\n\n```js\nlet count = $state(0);\n\nexport function getCount() {\n\treturn count;\n}\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## basic-markup\n\nError: Section not found."

                            "text": "## $state\n\nThe `$state` rune allows you to create _reactive state_, which means that your UI _reacts_ when it changes.\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet count = $state(0);\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => count++}>\n\tclicks: {count}\n</button>\n```\n\nUnlike other frameworks you may have encountered, there is no API for interacting with state — `count` is just a number, rather than an object or a function, and you can update it like you would update any other variable.\n\n### Deep state\n\nIf `$state` is used with an array or a simple object, the result is a deeply reactive _state proxy_. [Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) allow Svelte to run code when you read or write properties, including via methods like `array.push(...)`, triggering granular updates.\n\nState is proxified recursively until Svelte finds something other than an array or simple object (like a class or an object created with `Object.create`). In a case like this...\n\n```js\nlet todos = $state([\n\t{\n\t\tdone: false,\n\t\ttext: 'add more todos'\n\t}\n]);\n```\n\n...modifying an individual todo's property will trigger updates to anything in your UI that depends on that specific property:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\nIf you push a new object to the array, it will also be proxified:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos.push({\n\tdone: false,\n\ttext: 'eat lunch'\n});\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] When you update properties of proxies, the original object is _not_ mutated. If you need to use your own proxy handlers in a state proxy, [you should wrap the object _after_ wrapping it in `$state`](https://svelte.dev/playground/hello-world?version=latest#H4sIAAAAAAAACpWR3WoDIRCFX2UqhWyIJL3erAulL9C7XnQLMe5ksbUqOpsfln33YuyGFNJC8UKdc2bOhw7Myk9kJXsJ0nttO9jcR5KEG9AWJDwHdzwxznbaYGTl68Do5JM_FRifuh-9X8Y9Gkq1rYx4q66cJbQUWcmqqIL2VDe2IYMEbvuOikBADi-GJDSkXG-phId0G-frye2DO2psQYDFQ0Ys8gQO350dUkEydEg82T0GOs0nsSG9g2IqgxACZueo2ZUlpdvoDC6N64qsg1QKY8T2bpZp8gpIfbCQ85Zn50Ud82HkeY83uDjspenxv3jXcSDyjPWf9L1vJf0GH666J-jLu1ery4dV257IWXBWGa0-xFDMQdTTn2ScxWKsn86ROsLwQxqrVR5QM84Ij8TKFD2-cUZSm4O2LSt30kQcvwCgCmfZnAIAAA==).\n\nNote that if you destructure a reactive value, the references are not reactive — as in normal JavaScript, they are evaluated at the point of destructuring:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\nlet { done, text } = todos[0];\n\n// this will not affect the value of `done`\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\n### Classes\n\nClass instances are not proxied. Instead, you can use `$state` in class fields (whether public or private), or as the first assignment to a property immediately inside the `constructor`:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\treset() {\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] The compiler transforms `done` and `text` into `get`/`set` methods on the class prototype referencing private fields. This means the properties are not enumerable.\n\nWhen calling methods in JavaScript, the value of [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) matters. This won't work, because `this` inside the `reset` method will be the `<button>` rather than the `Todo`:\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick={todo.reset}>\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\nYou can either use an inline function...\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick=+++{() => todo.reset()}>+++\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\n...or use an arrow function in the class definition:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\t+++reset = () => {+++\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Built-in classes\n\nSvelte provides reactive implementations of built-in classes like `Set`, `Map`, `Date` and `URL` that can be imported from [`svelte/reactivity`](svelte-reactivity).\n\n## `$state.raw`\n\nIn cases where you don't want objects and arrays to be deeply reactive you can use `$state.raw`.\n\nState declared with `$state.raw` cannot be mutated; it can only be _reassigned_. In other words, rather than assigning to a property of an object, or using an array method like `push`, replace the object or array altogether if you'd like to update it:\n\n```js\nlet person = $state.raw({\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 49\n});\n\n// this will have no effect\nperson.age += 1;\n\n// this will work, because we're creating a new person\nperson = {\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 50\n};\n```\n\nThis can improve performance with large arrays and objects that you weren't planning to mutate anyway, since it avoids the cost of making them reactive. Note that raw state can _contain_ reactive state (for example, a raw array of reactive objects).\n\nAs with `$state`, you can declare class fields using `$state.raw`.\n\n## `$state.snapshot`\n\nTo take a static snapshot of a deeply reactive `$state` proxy, use `$state.snapshot`:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet counter = $state({ count: 0 });\n\n\tfunction onclick() {\n\t\t// Will log `{ count: ... }` rather than `Proxy { ... }`\n\t\tconsole.log($state.snapshot(counter));\n\t}\n</script>\n```\n\nThis is handy when you want to pass some state to an external library or API that doesn't expect a proxy, such as `structuredClone`.\n\n## `$state.eager`\n\nWhen state changes, it may not be reflected in the UI immediately if it is used by an `await` expression, because [updates are synchronized](await-expressions#Synchronized-updates).\n\nIn some cases, you may want to update the UI as soon as the state changes. For example, you might want to update a navigation bar when the user clicks on a link, so that they get visual feedback while waiting for the new page to load. To do this, use `$state.eager(value)`:\n\n```svelte\n<nav>\n\t<a href=\"/\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/' ? 'page' : null}>home</a>\n\t<a href=\"/about\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/about' ? 'page' : null}>about</a>\n</nav>\n```\n\nUse this feature sparingly, and only to provide feedback in response to user action — in general, allowing Svelte to coordinate updates will provide a better user experience.\n\n## Passing state into functions\n\nJavaScript is a _pass-by-value_ language — when you call a function, the arguments are the _values_ rather than the _variables_. In other words:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {number} a\n * @param {number} b\n */\nfunction add(a, b) {\n\treturn a + b;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add(a, b);\nconsole.log(total); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(total); // still 3!\n```\n\nIf `add` wanted to have access to the _current_ values of `a` and `b`, and to return the current `total` value, you would need to use functions instead:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {() => number} getA\n * @param {() => number} getB\n */\nfunction add(+++getA, getB+++) {\n\treturn +++() => getA() + getB()+++;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add+++(() => a, () => b)+++;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 7\n```\n\nState in Svelte is no different — when you reference something declared with the `$state` rune...\n\n```js\nlet a = +++$state(1)+++;\nlet b = +++$state(2)+++;\n```\n\n...you're accessing its _current value_.\n\nNote that 'functions' is broad — it encompasses properties of proxies and [`get`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get)/[`set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) properties...\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {{ a: number, b: number }} input\n */\nfunction add(input) {\n\treturn {\n\t\tget value() {\n\t\t\treturn input.a + input.b;\n\t\t}\n\t};\n}\n\nlet input = $state({ a: 1, b: 2 });\nlet total = add(input);\nconsole.log(total.value); // 3\n\ninput.a = 3;\ninput.b = 4;\nconsole.log(total.value); // 7\n```\n\n...though if you find yourself writing code like that, consider using [classes](#Classes) instead.\n\n## Passing state across modules\n\nYou can declare state in `.svelte.js` and `.svelte.ts` files, but you can only _export_ that state if it's not directly reassigned. In other words you can't do this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = $state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\nThat's because every reference to `count` is transformed by the Svelte compiler — the code above is roughly equivalent to this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js (compiler output)\n// @filename: index.ts\ninterface Signal<T> {\n\tvalue: T;\n}\n\ninterface Svelte {\n\tstate<T>(value?: T): Signal<T>;\n\tget<T>(source: Signal<T>): T;\n\tset<T>(source: Signal<T>, value: T): void;\n}\ndeclare const $: Svelte;\n// ---cut---\nexport let count = $.state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\t$.set(count, $.get(count) + 1);\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] You can see the code Svelte generates by clicking the 'JS Output' tab in the [playground](/playground).\n\nSince the compiler only operates on one file at a time, if another file imports `count` Svelte doesn't know that it needs to wrap each reference in `$.get` and `$.set`:\n\n```js\n// @filename: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = 0;\n\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\nimport { count } from './state.svelte.js';\n\nconsole.log(typeof count); // 'object', not 'number'\n```\n\nThis leaves you with two options for sharing state between modules — either don't reassign it...\n\n```js\n// This is allowed — since we're updating\n// `counter.count` rather than `counter`,\n// Svelte doesn't wrap it in `$.state`\nexport const counter = $state({\n\tcount: 0\n});\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcounter.count += 1;\n}\n```\n\n...or don't directly export it:\n\n```js\nlet count = $state(0);\n\nexport function getCount() {\n\treturn count;\n}\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## basic-markup\n\nError: Section not found."

Create a text input field that allows the user to enter text\n2. Use `$state` to store the current text value, starting with an empty string\n3. Use `$derived.by` to calculate:\n   - The number of words in the text\n   - The number of characters in the text\n   - Whether the text is considered \"long\" (more than 15 words)\n4. Display all these derived values below the input field\n5. Include a \"Clear\" button that resets the text to an empty string\n\nElements should have these data-testid attributes:\n\n- \"text-input\" for the input field\n- \"word-count\" for displaying the word count\n- \"char-count\" for displaying the character count\n- \"length-indicator\" for displaying whether the text is long\n- \"clear-button\" for the clear button\n\nExample structure:\n\n```html\n<div>\n  <input data-testid=\"text-input\" type=\"text\" />\n  <button data-testid=\"clear-button\">Clear</button>\n  <div>\n    <p data-testid=\"word-count\">Words: 0</p>\n    <p data-testid=\"char-count\">Characters: 0</p>\n    <p data-testid=\"length-indicator\">Status: Short text</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nPlease implement this component using Svelte 5 runes.\n",

Svelte will disallow state changes (e.g. `count++`) inside derived expressions.\n\nAs with `$state`, you can mark class fields as `$derived`.\n\n> [!NOTE] Code in Svelte components is only executed once at creation. Without the `$derived` rune, `doubled` would maintain its original value even when `count` changes.\n\n## `$derived.by`\n\nSometimes you need to create complex derivations that don't fit inside a short expression. In these cases, you can use `$derived.by` which accepts a function as its argument.\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet numbers = $state([1, 2, 3]);\n\tlet total = $derived.by(() => {\n\t\tlet total = 0;\n\t\tfor (const n of numbers) {\n\t\t\ttotal += n;\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn total;\n\t});\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => numbers.push(numbers.length + 1)}>\n\t{numbers.join(' + ')} = {total}\n</button>\n```\n\nIn essence, `$derived(expression)` is equivalent to `$derived.by(() => expression)`.\n\n## Understanding dependencies\n\nAnything read synchronously inside the `$derived` expression (or `$derived.by` function body) is considered a _dependency_ of the derived state. When the state changes, the derived will be marked as _dirty_ and recalculated when it is next read.\n\nTo exempt a piece of state from being treated as a dependency, use [`untrack`](svelte#untrack).\n\n## Overriding derived values\n\nDerived expressions are recalculated when their dependencies change, but you can temporarily override their values by reassigning them (unless they are declared with `const`). This can be useful for things like _optimistic UI_, where a value is derived from the 'source of truth' (such as data from your server) but you'd like to show immediate feedback to the user:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet { post, like } = $props();\n\n\tlet likes = $derived(post.likes);\n\n\tasync function onclick() {\n\t\t// increment the `likes` count immediately...\n\t\tlikes += 1;\n\n\t\t// and tell the server, which will eventually update `post`\n\t\ttry {\n\t\t\tawait like();\n\t\t} catch {\n\t\t\t// failed! roll back the change\n\t\t\tlikes -= 1;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n</script>\n\n<button {onclick}>🧡 {likes}</button>\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] Prior to Svelte 5.25, deriveds were read-only.\n\n## Deriveds and reactivity\n\nUnlike `$state`, which converts objects and arrays to [deeply reactive proxies]($state#Deep-state), `$derived` values are left as-is. For example, [in a case like this](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE4VU22rjMBD9lUHd3aaQi9PdstS1A3t5XvpQ2Ic4D7I1iUUV2UjjNMX431eS7TRdSosxgjMzZ45mjt0yzffIYibvy0ojFJWqDKCQVBk2ZVup0LJ43TJ6rn2aBxw-FP2o67k9oCKP5dziW3hRaUJNjoYltjCyplWmM1JIIAn3FlL4ZIkTTtYez6jtj4w8WwyXv9GiIXiQxLVs9pfTMR7EuoSLIuLFbX7Z4930bZo_nBrD1bs834tlfvsBz9_SyX6PZXu9XaL4gOWn4sXjeyzftv4ZWfyxubpzxzg6LfD4MrooxELEosKCUPigQCMPKCZh0OtQE1iSxcsmdHuBvCiHZXALLXiN08EL3RRkaJ_kDVGle0HcSD5TPEeVtj67O4Nrg9aiSNtBY5oODJkrL5QsHtN2cgXp6nSJMWzpWWGasdlsGEMbzi5jPr5KFr0Ep7pdeM2-TCelCddIhDxAobi1jqF3cMaC1RKp64bAW9iFAmXGIHfd4wNXDabtOLN53w8W53VvJoZLh7xk4Rr3CoL-UNoLhWHrT1JQGcM17u96oES5K-kc2XOzkzqGCKL5De79OUTyyrg1zgwXsrEx3ESfx4Bz0M5UjVMHB24mw9SuXtXFoN13fYKOM1tyUT3FbvbWmSWCZX2Er-41u5xPoml45svRahl9Wb9aasbINJixDZwcPTbyTLZSUsAvrg_cPuCR7s782_WU8343Y72Qtlb8OYatwuOQvuN13M_hJKNfxann1v1U_B1KZ_D_mzhzhz24fw85CSz2irtN9w9HshBK7AQAAA==)...\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7005\nlet items = $state([ /*...*/ ]);\n\nlet index = $state(0);\nlet selected = $derived(items[index]);\n```\n\n...you can change (or `bind:` to) properties of `selected` and it will affect the underlying `items` array. If `items` was _not_ deeply reactive, mutating `selected` would have no effect.\n\n## Destructuring\n\nIf you use destructuring with a `$derived` declaration, the resulting variables will all be reactive — this...\n\n```js\nfunction stuff() { return { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 } }\n// ---cut---\nlet { a, b, c } = $derived(stuff());\n```\n\n...is roughly equivalent to this:\n\n```js\nfunction stuff() { return { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 } }\n// ---cut---\nlet _stuff = $derived(stuff());\nlet a = $derived(_stuff.a);\nlet b = $derived(_stuff.b);\nlet c = $derived(_stuff.c);\n```\n\n## Update propagation\n\nSvelte uses something called _push-pull reactivity_ — when state is updated, everything that depends on the state (whether directly or indirectly) is immediately notified of the change (the 'push'), but derived values are not re-evaluated until they are actually read (the 'pull').\n\nIf the new value of a derived is referentially identical to its previous value, downstream updates will be skipped. In other words, Svelte will only update the text inside the button when `large` changes, not when `count` changes, even though `large` depends on `count`:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet count = $state(0);\n\tlet large = $derived(count > 10);\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => count++}>\n\t{large}\n</button>\n```\n\n---\n\n## $state\n\nThe `$state` rune allows you to create _reactive state_, which means that your UI _reacts_ when it changes.\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet count = $state(0);\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => count++}>\n\tclicks: {count}\n</button>\n```\n\nUnlike other frameworks you may have encountered, there is no API for interacting with state — `count` is just a number, rather than an object or a function, and you can update it like you would update any other variable.\n\n### Deep state\n\nIf `$state` is used with an array or a simple object, the result is a deeply reactive _state proxy_. [Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) allow Svelte to run code when you read or write properties, including via methods like `array.push(...)`, triggering granular updates.\n\nState is proxified recursively until Svelte finds something other than an array or simple object (like a class or an object created with `Object.create`). In a case like this...\n\n```js\nlet todos = $state([\n\t{\n\t\tdone: false,\n\t\ttext: 'add more todos'\n\t}\n]);\n```\n\n...modifying an individual todo's property will trigger updates to anything in your UI that depends on that specific property:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\nIf you push a new object to the array, it will also be proxified:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos.push({\n\tdone: false,\n\ttext: 'eat lunch'\n});\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] When you update properties of proxies, the original object is _not_ mutated. If you need to use your own proxy handlers in a state proxy, [you should wrap the object _after_ wrapping it in `$state`](https://svelte.dev/playground/hello-world?version=latest#H4sIAAAAAAAACpWR3WoDIRCFX2UqhWyIJL3erAulL9C7XnQLMe5ksbUqOpsfln33YuyGFNJC8UKdc2bOhw7Myk9kJXsJ0nttO9jcR5KEG9AWJDwHdzwxznbaYGTl68Do5JM_FRifuh-9X8Y9Gkq1rYx4q66cJbQUWcmqqIL2VDe2IYMEbvuOikBADi-GJDSkXG-phId0G-frye2DO2psQYDFQ0Ys8gQO350dUkEydEg82T0GOs0nsSG9g2IqgxACZueo2ZUlpdvoDC6N64qsg1QKY8T2bpZp8gpIfbCQ85Zn50Ud82HkeY83uDjspenxv3jXcSDyjPWf9L1vJf0GH666J-jLu1ery4dV257IWXBWGa0-xFDMQdTTn2ScxWKsn86ROsLwQxqrVR5QM84Ij8TKFD2-cUZSm4O2LSt30kQcvwCgCmfZnAIAAA==).\n\nNote that if you destructure a reactive value, the references are not reactive — as in normal JavaScript, they are evaluated at the point of destructuring:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\nlet { done, text } = todos[0];\n\n// this will not affect the value of `done`\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\n### Classes\n\nClass instances are not proxied. Instead, you can use `$state` in class fields (whether public or private), or as the first assignment to a property immediately inside the `constructor`:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\treset() {\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] The compiler transforms `done` and `text` into `get`/`set` methods on the class prototype referencing private fields. This means the properties are not enumerable.\n\nWhen calling methods in JavaScript, the value of [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) matters. This won't work, because `this` inside the `reset` method will be the `<button>` rather than the `Todo`:\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick={todo.reset}>\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\nYou can either use an inline function...\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick=+++{() => todo.reset()}>+++\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\n...or use an arrow function in the class definition:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\t+++reset = () => {+++\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Built-in classes\n\nSvelte provides reactive implementations of built-in classes like `Set`, `Map`, `Date` and `URL` that can be imported from [`svelte/reactivity`](svelte-reactivity).\n\n## `$state.raw`\n\nIn cases where you don't want objects and arrays to be deeply reactive you can use `$state.raw`.\n\nState declared with `$state.raw` cannot be mutated; it can only be _reassigned_. In other words, rather than assigning to a property of an object, or using an array method like `push`, replace the object or array altogether if you'd like to update it:\n\n```js\nlet person = $state.raw({\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 49\n});\n\n// this will have no effect\nperson.age += 1;\n\n// this will work, because we're creating a new person\nperson = {\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 50\n};\n```\n\nThis can improve performance with large arrays and objects that you weren't planning to mutate anyway, since it avoids the cost of making them reactive. Note that raw state can _contain_ reactive state (for example, a raw array of reactive objects).\n\nAs with `$state`, you can declare class fields using `$state.raw`.\n\n## `$state.snapshot`\n\nTo take a static snapshot of a deeply reactive `$state` proxy, use `$state.snapshot`:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet counter = $state({ count: 0 });\n\n\tfunction onclick() {\n\t\t// Will log `{ count: ... }` rather than `Proxy { ... }`\n\t\tconsole.log($state.snapshot(counter));\n\t}\n</script>\n```\n\nThis is handy when you want to pass some state to an external library or API that doesn't expect a proxy, such as `structuredClone`.\n\n## `$state.eager`\n\nWhen state changes, it may not be reflected in the UI immediately if it is used by an `await` expression, because [updates are synchronized](await-expressions#Synchronized-updates).\n\nIn some cases, you may want to update the UI as soon as the state changes. For example, you might want to update a navigation bar when the user clicks on a link, so that they get visual feedback while waiting for the new page to load. To do this, use `$state.eager(value)`:\n\n```svelte\n<nav>\n\t<a href=\"/\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/' ? 'page' : null}>home</a>\n\t<a href=\"/about\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/about' ? 'page' : null}>about</a>\n</nav>\n```\n\nUse this feature sparingly, and only to provide feedback in response to user action — in general, allowing Svelte to coordinate updates will provide a better user experience.\n\n## Passing state into functions\n\nJavaScript is a _pass-by-value_ language — when you call a function, the arguments are the _values_ rather than the _variables_. In other words:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {number} a\n * @param {number} b\n */\nfunction add(a, b) {\n\treturn a + b;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add(a, b);\nconsole.log(total); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(total); // still 3!\n```\n\nIf `add` wanted to have access to the _current_ values of `a` and `b`, and to return the current `total` value, you would need to use functions instead:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {() => number} getA\n * @param {() => number} getB\n */\nfunction add(+++getA, getB+++) {\n\treturn +++() => getA() + getB()+++;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add+++(() => a, () => b)+++;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 7\n```\n\nState in Svelte is no different — when you reference something declared with the `$state` rune...\n\n```js\nlet a = +++$state(1)+++;\nlet b = +++$state(2)+++;\n```\n\n...you're accessing its _current value_.\n\nNote that 'functions' is broad — it encompasses properties of proxies and [`get`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get)/[`set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) properties...\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {{ a: number, b: number }} input\n */\nfunction add(input) {\n\treturn {\n\t\tget value() {\n\t\t\treturn input.a + input.b;\n\t\t}\n\t};\n}\n\nlet input = $state({ a: 1, b: 2 });\nlet total = add(input);\nconsole.log(total.value); // 3\n\ninput.a = 3;\ninput.b = 4;\nconsole.log(total.value); // 7\n```\n\n...though if you find yourself writing code like that, consider using [classes](#Classes) instead.\n\n## Passing state across modules\n\nYou can declare state in `.svelte.js` and `.svelte.ts` files, but you can only _export_ that state if it's not directly reassigned. In other words you can't do this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = $state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\nThat's because every reference to `count` is transformed by the Svelte compiler — the code above is roughly equivalent to this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js (compiler output)\n// @filename: index.ts\ninterface Signal<T> {\n\tvalue: T;\n}\n\ninterface Svelte {\n\tstate<T>(value?: T): Signal<T>;\n\tget<T>(source: Signal<T>): T;\n\tset<T>(source: Signal<T>, value: T): void;\n}\ndeclare const $: Svelte;\n// ---cut---\nexport let count = $.state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\t$.set(count, $.get(count) + 1);\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] You can see the code Svelte generates by clicking the 'JS Output' tab in the [playground](/playground).\n\nSince the compiler only operates on one file at a time, if another file imports `count` Svelte doesn't know that it needs to wrap each reference in `$.get` and `$.set`:\n\n```js\n// @filename: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = 0;\n\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\nimport { count } from './state.svelte.js';\n\nconsole.log(typeof count); // 'object', not 'number'\n```\n\nThis leaves you with two options for sharing state between modules — either don't reassign it...\n\n```js\n// This is allowed — since we're updating\n// `counter.count` rather than `counter`,\n// Svelte doesn't wrap it in `$.state`\nexport const counter = $state({\n\tcount: 0\n});\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcounter.count += 1;\n}\n```\n\n...or don't directly export it:\n\n```js\nlet count = $state(0);\n\nexport function getCount() {\n\treturn count;\n}\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```"

Use `$derived.by` to calculate:\n   - The number of words in the text\n   - The number of characters in the text\n   - Whether the text is considered \"long\" (more than 15 words)\n4. Display all these derived values below the input field\n5. Include a \"Clear\" button that resets the text to an empty string\n\nElements should have these data-testid attributes:\n\n- \"text-input\" for the input field\n- \"word-count\" for displaying the word count\n- \"char-count\" for displaying the character count\n- \"length-indicator\" for displaying whether the text is long\n- \"clear-button\" for the clear button\n\nExample structure:\n\n```html\n<div>\n  <input data-testid=\"text-input\" type=\"text\" />\n  <button data-testid=\"clear-button\">Clear</button>\n  <div>\n    <p data-testid=\"word-count\">Words: 0</p>\n    <p data-testid=\"char-count\">Characters: 0</p>\n    <p data-testid=\"length-indicator\">Status: Short text</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nPlease implement this component using Svelte 5 runes.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: When you have finished implementing the component, use the ResultWrite tool to output your final Svelte component code. Only output the component code itself, no explanations or markdown formatting."

Svelte will disallow state changes (e.g. `count++`) inside derived expressions.\n\nAs with `$state`, you can mark class fields as `$derived`.\n\n> [!NOTE] Code in Svelte components is only executed once at creation. Without the `$derived` rune, `doubled` would maintain its original value even when `count` changes.\n\n## `$derived.by`\n\nSometimes you need to create complex derivations that don't fit inside a short expression. In these cases, you can use `$derived.by` which accepts a function as its argument.\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet numbers = $state([1, 2, 3]);\n\tlet total = $derived.by(() => {\n\t\tlet total = 0;\n\t\tfor (const n of numbers) {\n\t\t\ttotal += n;\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn total;\n\t});\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => numbers.push(numbers.length + 1)}>\n\t{numbers.join(' + ')} = {total}\n</button>\n```\n\nIn essence, `$derived(expression)` is equivalent to `$derived.by(() => expression)`.\n\n## Understanding dependencies\n\nAnything read synchronously inside the `$derived` expression (or `$derived.by` function body) is considered a _dependency_ of the derived state. When the state changes, the derived will be marked as _dirty_ and recalculated when it is next read.\n\nTo exempt a piece of state from being treated as a dependency, use [`untrack`](svelte#untrack).\n\n## Overriding derived values\n\nDerived expressions are recalculated when their dependencies change, but you can temporarily override their values by reassigning them (unless they are declared with `const`). This can be useful for things like _optimistic UI_, where a value is derived from the 'source of truth' (such as data from your server) but you'd like to show immediate feedback to the user:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet { post, like } = $props();\n\n\tlet likes = $derived(post.likes);\n\n\tasync function onclick() {\n\t\t// increment the `likes` count immediately...\n\t\tlikes += 1;\n\n\t\t// and tell the server, which will eventually update `post`\n\t\ttry {\n\t\t\tawait like();\n\t\t} catch {\n\t\t\t// failed! roll back the change\n\t\t\tlikes -= 1;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n</script>\n\n<button {onclick}>🧡 {likes}</button>\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] Prior to Svelte 5.25, deriveds were read-only.\n\n## Deriveds and reactivity\n\nUnlike `$state`, which converts objects and arrays to [deeply reactive proxies]($state#Deep-state), `$derived` values are left as-is. For example, [in a case like this](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE4VU22rjMBD9lUHd3aaQi9PdstS1A3t5XvpQ2Ic4D7I1iUUV2UjjNMX431eS7TRdSosxgjMzZ45mjt0yzffIYibvy0ojFJWqDKCQVBk2ZVup0LJ43TJ6rn2aBxw-FP2o67k9oCKP5dziW3hRaUJNjoYltjCyplWmM1JIIAn3FlL4ZIkTTtYez6jtj4w8WwyXv9GiIXiQxLVs9pfTMR7EuoSLIuLFbX7Z4930bZo_nBrD1bs834tlfvsBz9_SyX6PZXu9XaL4gOWn4sXjeyzftv4ZWfyxubpzxzg6LfD4MrooxELEosKCUPigQCMPKCZh0OtQE1iSxcsmdHuBvCiHZXALLXiN08EL3RRkaJ_kDVGle0HcSD5TPEeVtj67O4Nrg9aiSNtBY5oODJkrL5QsHtN2cgXp6nSJMWzpWWGasdlsGEMbzi5jPr5KFr0Ep7pdeM2-TCelCddIhDxAobi1jqF3cMaC1RKp64bAW9iFAmXGIHfd4wNXDabtOLN53w8W53VvJoZLh7xk4Rr3CoL-UNoLhWHrT1JQGcM17u96oES5K-kc2XOzkzqGCKL5De79OUTyyrg1zgwXsrEx3ESfx4Bz0M5UjVMHB24mw9SuXtXFoN13fYKOM1tyUT3FbvbWmSWCZX2Er-41u5xPoml45svRahl9Wb9aasbINJixDZwcPTbyTLZSUsAvrg_cPuCR7s782_WU8343Y72Qtlb8OYatwuOQvuN13M_hJKNfxann1v1U_B1KZ_D_mzhzhz24fw85CSz2irtN9w9HshBK7AQAAA==)...\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7005\nlet items = $state([ /*...*/ ]);\n\nlet index = $state(0);\nlet selected = $derived(items[index]);\n```\n\n...you can change (or `bind:` to) properties of `selected` and it will affect the underlying `items` array. If `items` was _not_ deeply reactive, mutating `selected` would have no effect.\n\n## Destructuring\n\nIf you use destructuring with a `$derived` declaration, the resulting variables will all be reactive — this...\n\n```js\nfunction stuff() { return { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 } }\n// ---cut---\nlet { a, b, c } = $derived(stuff());\n```\n\n...is roughly equivalent to this:\n\n```js\nfunction stuff() { return { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 } }\n// ---cut---\nlet _stuff = $derived(stuff());\nlet a = $derived(_stuff.a);\nlet b = $derived(_stuff.b);\nlet c = $derived(_stuff.c);\n```\n\n## Update propagation\n\nSvelte uses something called _push-pull reactivity_ — when state is updated, everything that depends on the state (whether directly or indirectly) is immediately notified of the change (the 'push'), but derived values are not re-evaluated until they are actually read (the 'pull').\n\nIf the new value of a derived is referentially identical to its previous value, downstream updates will be skipped. In other words, Svelte will only update the text inside the button when `large` changes, not when `count` changes, even though `large` depends on `count`:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet count = $state(0);\n\tlet large = $derived(count > 10);\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => count++}>\n\t{large}\n</button>\n```\n\n---\n\n## $state\n\nThe `$state` rune allows you to create _reactive state_, which means that your UI _reacts_ when it changes.\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet count = $state(0);\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => count++}>\n\tclicks: {count}\n</button>\n```\n\nUnlike other frameworks you may have encountered, there is no API for interacting with state — `count` is just a number, rather than an object or a function, and you can update it like you would update any other variable.\n\n### Deep state\n\nIf `$state` is used with an array or a simple object, the result is a deeply reactive _state proxy_. [Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) allow Svelte to run code when you read or write properties, including via methods like `array.push(...)`, triggering granular updates.\n\nState is proxified recursively until Svelte finds something other than an array or simple object (like a class or an object created with `Object.create`). In a case like this...\n\n```js\nlet todos = $state([\n\t{\n\t\tdone: false,\n\t\ttext: 'add more todos'\n\t}\n]);\n```\n\n...modifying an individual todo's property will trigger updates to anything in your UI that depends on that specific property:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\nIf you push a new object to the array, it will also be proxified:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos.push({\n\tdone: false,\n\ttext: 'eat lunch'\n});\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] When you update properties of proxies, the original object is _not_ mutated. If you need to use your own proxy handlers in a state proxy, [you should wrap the object _after_ wrapping it in `$state`](https://svelte.dev/playground/hello-world?version=latest#H4sIAAAAAAAACpWR3WoDIRCFX2UqhWyIJL3erAulL9C7XnQLMe5ksbUqOpsfln33YuyGFNJC8UKdc2bOhw7Myk9kJXsJ0nttO9jcR5KEG9AWJDwHdzwxznbaYGTl68Do5JM_FRifuh-9X8Y9Gkq1rYx4q66cJbQUWcmqqIL2VDe2IYMEbvuOikBADi-GJDSkXG-phId0G-frye2DO2psQYDFQ0Ys8gQO350dUkEydEg82T0GOs0nsSG9g2IqgxACZueo2ZUlpdvoDC6N64qsg1QKY8T2bpZp8gpIfbCQ85Zn50Ud82HkeY83uDjspenxv3jXcSDyjPWf9L1vJf0GH666J-jLu1ery4dV257IWXBWGa0-xFDMQdTTn2ScxWKsn86ROsLwQxqrVR5QM84Ij8TKFD2-cUZSm4O2LSt30kQcvwCgCmfZnAIAAA==).\n\nNote that if you destructure a reactive value, the references are not reactive — as in normal JavaScript, they are evaluated at the point of destructuring:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\nlet { done, text } = todos[0];\n\n// this will not affect the value of `done`\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\n### Classes\n\nClass instances are not proxied. Instead, you can use `$state` in class fields (whether public or private), or as the first assignment to a property immediately inside the `constructor`:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\treset() {\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] The compiler transforms `done` and `text` into `get`/`set` methods on the class prototype referencing private fields. This means the properties are not enumerable.\n\nWhen calling methods in JavaScript, the value of [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) matters. This won't work, because `this` inside the `reset` method will be the `<button>` rather than the `Todo`:\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick={todo.reset}>\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\nYou can either use an inline function...\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick=+++{() => todo.reset()}>+++\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\n...or use an arrow function in the class definition:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\t+++reset = () => {+++\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Built-in classes\n\nSvelte provides reactive implementations of built-in classes like `Set`, `Map`, `Date` and `URL` that can be imported from [`svelte/reactivity`](svelte-reactivity).\n\n## `$state.raw`\n\nIn cases where you don't want objects and arrays to be deeply reactive you can use `$state.raw`.\n\nState declared with `$state.raw` cannot be mutated; it can only be _reassigned_. In other words, rather than assigning to a property of an object, or using an array method like `push`, replace the object or array altogether if you'd like to update it:\n\n```js\nlet person = $state.raw({\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 49\n});\n\n// this will have no effect\nperson.age += 1;\n\n// this will work, because we're creating a new person\nperson = {\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 50\n};\n```\n\nThis can improve performance with large arrays and objects that you weren't planning to mutate anyway, since it avoids the cost of making them reactive. Note that raw state can _contain_ reactive state (for example, a raw array of reactive objects).\n\nAs with `$state`, you can declare class fields using `$state.raw`.\n\n## `$state.snapshot`\n\nTo take a static snapshot of a deeply reactive `$state` proxy, use `$state.snapshot`:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet counter = $state({ count: 0 });\n\n\tfunction onclick() {\n\t\t// Will log `{ count: ... }` rather than `Proxy { ... }`\n\t\tconsole.log($state.snapshot(counter));\n\t}\n</script>\n```\n\nThis is handy when you want to pass some state to an external library or API that doesn't expect a proxy, such as `structuredClone`.\n\n## `$state.eager`\n\nWhen state changes, it may not be reflected in the UI immediately if it is used by an `await` expression, because [updates are synchronized](await-expressions#Synchronized-updates).\n\nIn some cases, you may want to update the UI as soon as the state changes. For example, you might want to update a navigation bar when the user clicks on a link, so that they get visual feedback while waiting for the new page to load. To do this, use `$state.eager(value)`:\n\n```svelte\n<nav>\n\t<a href=\"/\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/' ? 'page' : null}>home</a>\n\t<a href=\"/about\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/about' ? 'page' : null}>about</a>\n</nav>\n```\n\nUse this feature sparingly, and only to provide feedback in response to user action — in general, allowing Svelte to coordinate updates will provide a better user experience.\n\n## Passing state into functions\n\nJavaScript is a _pass-by-value_ language — when you call a function, the arguments are the _values_ rather than the _variables_. In other words:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {number} a\n * @param {number} b\n */\nfunction add(a, b) {\n\treturn a + b;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add(a, b);\nconsole.log(total); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(total); // still 3!\n```\n\nIf `add` wanted to have access to the _current_ values of `a` and `b`, and to return the current `total` value, you would need to use functions instead:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {() => number} getA\n * @param {() => number} getB\n */\nfunction add(+++getA, getB+++) {\n\treturn +++() => getA() + getB()+++;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add+++(() => a, () => b)+++;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 7\n```\n\nState in Svelte is no different — when you reference something declared with the `$state` rune...\n\n```js\nlet a = +++$state(1)+++;\nlet b = +++$state(2)+++;\n```\n\n...you're accessing its _current value_.\n\nNote that 'functions' is broad — it encompasses properties of proxies and [`get`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get)/[`set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) properties...\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {{ a: number, b: number }} input\n */\nfunction add(input) {\n\treturn {\n\t\tget value() {\n\t\t\treturn input.a + input.b;\n\t\t}\n\t};\n}\n\nlet input = $state({ a: 1, b: 2 });\nlet total = add(input);\nconsole.log(total.value); // 3\n\ninput.a = 3;\ninput.b = 4;\nconsole.log(total.value); // 7\n```\n\n...though if you find yourself writing code like that, consider using [classes](#Classes) instead.\n\n## Passing state across modules\n\nYou can declare state in `.svelte.js` and `.svelte.ts` files, but you can only _export_ that state if it's not directly reassigned. In other words you can't do this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = $state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\nThat's because every reference to `count` is transformed by the Svelte compiler — the code above is roughly equivalent to this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js (compiler output)\n// @filename: index.ts\ninterface Signal<T> {\n\tvalue: T;\n}\n\ninterface Svelte {\n\tstate<T>(value?: T): Signal<T>;\n\tget<T>(source: Signal<T>): T;\n\tset<T>(source: Signal<T>, value: T): void;\n}\ndeclare const $: Svelte;\n// ---cut---\nexport let count = $.state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\t$.set(count, $.get(count) + 1);\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] You can see the code Svelte generates by clicking the 'JS Output' tab in the [playground](/playground).\n\nSince the compiler only operates on one file at a time, if another file imports `count` Svelte doesn't know that it needs to wrap each reference in `$.get` and `$.set`:\n\n```js\n// @filename: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = 0;\n\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\nimport { count } from './state.svelte.js';\n\nconsole.log(typeof count); // 'object', not 'number'\n```\n\nThis leaves you with two options for sharing state between modules — either don't reassign it...\n\n```js\n// This is allowed — since we're updating\n// `counter.count` rather than `counter`,\n// Svelte doesn't wrap it in `$.state`\nexport const counter = $state({\n\tcount: 0\n});\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcounter.count += 1;\n}\n```\n\n...or don't directly export it:\n\n```js\nlet count = $state(0);\n\nexport function getCount() {\n\treturn count;\n}\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```"

Svelte will disallow state changes (e.g. `count++`) inside derived expressions.\n\nAs with `$state`, you can mark class fields as `$derived`.\n\n> [!NOTE] Code in Svelte components is only executed once at creation. Without the `$derived` rune, `doubled` would maintain its original value even when `count` changes.\n\n## `$derived.by`\n\nSometimes you need to create complex derivations that don't fit inside a short expression. In these cases, you can use `$derived.by` which accepts a function as its argument.\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet numbers = $state([1, 2, 3]);\n\tlet total = $derived.by(() => {\n\t\tlet total = 0;\n\t\tfor (const n of numbers) {\n\t\t\ttotal += n;\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn total;\n\t});\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => numbers.push(numbers.length + 1)}>\n\t{numbers.join(' + ')} = {total}\n</button>\n```\n\nIn essence, `$derived(expression)` is equivalent to `$derived.by(() => expression)`.\n\n## Understanding dependencies\n\nAnything read synchronously inside the `$derived` expression (or `$derived.by` function body) is considered a _dependency_ of the derived state. When the state changes, the derived will be marked as _dirty_ and recalculated when it is next read.\n\nTo exempt a piece of state from being treated as a dependency, use [`untrack`](svelte#untrack).\n\n## Overriding derived values\n\nDerived expressions are recalculated when their dependencies change, but you can temporarily override their values by reassigning them (unless they are declared with `const`). This can be useful for things like _optimistic UI_, where a value is derived from the 'source of truth' (such as data from your server) but you'd like to show immediate feedback to the user:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet { post, like } = $props();\n\n\tlet likes = $derived(post.likes);\n\n\tasync function onclick() {\n\t\t// increment the `likes` count immediately...\n\t\tlikes += 1;\n\n\t\t// and tell the server, which will eventually update `post`\n\t\ttry {\n\t\t\tawait like();\n\t\t} catch {\n\t\t\t// failed! roll back the change\n\t\t\tlikes -= 1;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n</script>\n\n<button {onclick}>🧡 {likes}</button>\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] Prior to Svelte 5.25, deriveds were read-only.\n\n## Deriveds and reactivity\n\nUnlike `$state`, which converts objects and arrays to [deeply reactive proxies]($state#Deep-state), `$derived` values are left as-is. For example, [in a case like this](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE4VU22rjMBD9lUHd3aaQi9PdstS1A3t5XvpQ2Ic4D7I1iUUV2UjjNMX431eS7TRdSosxgjMzZ45mjt0yzffIYibvy0ojFJWqDKCQVBk2ZVup0LJ43TJ6rn2aBxw-FP2o67k9oCKP5dziW3hRaUJNjoYltjCyplWmM1JIIAn3FlL4ZIkTTtYez6jtj4w8WwyXv9GiIXiQxLVs9pfTMR7EuoSLIuLFbX7Z4930bZo_nBrD1bs834tlfvsBz9_SyX6PZXu9XaL4gOWn4sXjeyzftv4ZWfyxubpzxzg6LfD4MrooxELEosKCUPigQCMPKCZh0OtQE1iSxcsmdHuBvCiHZXALLXiN08EL3RRkaJ_kDVGle0HcSD5TPEeVtj67O4Nrg9aiSNtBY5oODJkrL5QsHtN2cgXp6nSJMWzpWWGasdlsGEMbzi5jPr5KFr0Ep7pdeM2-TCelCddIhDxAobi1jqF3cMaC1RKp64bAW9iFAmXGIHfd4wNXDabtOLN53w8W53VvJoZLh7xk4Rr3CoL-UNoLhWHrT1JQGcM17u96oES5K-kc2XOzkzqGCKL5De79OUTyyrg1zgwXsrEx3ESfx4Bz0M5UjVMHB24mw9SuXtXFoN13fYKOM1tyUT3FbvbWmSWCZX2Er-41u5xPoml45svRahl9Wb9aasbINJixDZwcPTbyTLZSUsAvrg_cPuCR7s782_WU8343Y72Qtlb8OYatwuOQvuN13M_hJKNfxann1v1U_B1KZ_D_mzhzhz24fw85CSz2irtN9w9HshBK7AQAAA==)...\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7005\nlet items = $state([ /*...*/ ]);\n\nlet index = $state(0);\nlet selected = $derived(items[index]);\n```\n\n...you can change (or `bind:` to) properties of `selected` and it will affect the underlying `items` array. If `items` was _not_ deeply reactive, mutating `selected` would have no effect.\n\n## Destructuring\n\nIf you use destructuring with a `$derived` declaration, the resulting variables will all be reactive — this...\n\n```js\nfunction stuff() { return { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 } }\n// ---cut---\nlet { a, b, c } = $derived(stuff());\n```\n\n...is roughly equivalent to this:\n\n```js\nfunction stuff() { return { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 } }\n// ---cut---\nlet _stuff = $derived(stuff());\nlet a = $derived(_stuff.a);\nlet b = $derived(_stuff.b);\nlet c = $derived(_stuff.c);\n```\n\n## Update propagation\n\nSvelte uses something called _push-pull reactivity_ — when state is updated, everything that depends on the state (whether directly or indirectly) is immediately notified of the change (the 'push'), but derived values are not re-evaluated until they are actually read (the 'pull').\n\nIf the new value of a derived is referentially identical to its previous value, downstream updates will be skipped. In other words, Svelte will only update the text inside the button when `large` changes, not when `count` changes, even though `large` depends on `count`:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet count = $state(0);\n\tlet large = $derived(count > 10);\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => count++}>\n\t{large}\n</button>\n```\n\n---\n\n## $state\n\nThe `$state` rune allows you to create _reactive state_, which means that your UI _reacts_ when it changes.\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet count = $state(0);\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => count++}>\n\tclicks: {count}\n</button>\n```\n\nUnlike other frameworks you may have encountered, there is no API for interacting with state — `count` is just a number, rather than an object or a function, and you can update it like you would update any other variable.\n\n### Deep state\n\nIf `$state` is used with an array or a simple object, the result is a deeply reactive _state proxy_. [Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) allow Svelte to run code when you read or write properties, including via methods like `array.push(...)`, triggering granular updates.\n\nState is proxified recursively until Svelte finds something other than an array or simple object (like a class or an object created with `Object.create`). In a case like this...\n\n```js\nlet todos = $state([\n\t{\n\t\tdone: false,\n\t\ttext: 'add more todos'\n\t}\n]);\n```\n\n...modifying an individual todo's property will trigger updates to anything in your UI that depends on that specific property:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\nIf you push a new object to the array, it will also be proxified:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos.push({\n\tdone: false,\n\ttext: 'eat lunch'\n});\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] When you update properties of proxies, the original object is _not_ mutated. If you need to use your own proxy handlers in a state proxy, [you should wrap the object _after_ wrapping it in `$state`](https://svelte.dev/playground/hello-world?version=latest#H4sIAAAAAAAACpWR3WoDIRCFX2UqhWyIJL3erAulL9C7XnQLMe5ksbUqOpsfln33YuyGFNJC8UKdc2bOhw7Myk9kJXsJ0nttO9jcR5KEG9AWJDwHdzwxznbaYGTl68Do5JM_FRifuh-9X8Y9Gkq1rYx4q66cJbQUWcmqqIL2VDe2IYMEbvuOikBADi-GJDSkXG-phId0G-frye2DO2psQYDFQ0Ys8gQO350dUkEydEg82T0GOs0nsSG9g2IqgxACZueo2ZUlpdvoDC6N64qsg1QKY8T2bpZp8gpIfbCQ85Zn50Ud82HkeY83uDjspenxv3jXcSDyjPWf9L1vJf0GH666J-jLu1ery4dV257IWXBWGa0-xFDMQdTTn2ScxWKsn86ROsLwQxqrVR5QM84Ij8TKFD2-cUZSm4O2LSt30kQcvwCgCmfZnAIAAA==).\n\nNote that if you destructure a reactive value, the references are not reactive — as in normal JavaScript, they are evaluated at the point of destructuring:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\nlet { done, text } = todos[0];\n\n// this will not affect the value of `done`\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\n### Classes\n\nClass instances are not proxied. Instead, you can use `$state` in class fields (whether public or private), or as the first assignment to a property immediately inside the `constructor`:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\treset() {\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] The compiler transforms `done` and `text` into `get`/`set` methods on the class prototype referencing private fields. This means the properties are not enumerable.\n\nWhen calling methods in JavaScript, the value of [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) matters. This won't work, because `this` inside the `reset` method will be the `<button>` rather than the `Todo`:\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick={todo.reset}>\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\nYou can either use an inline function...\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick=+++{() => todo.reset()}>+++\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\n...or use an arrow function in the class definition:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\t+++reset = () => {+++\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Built-in classes\n\nSvelte provides reactive implementations of built-in classes like `Set`, `Map`, `Date` and `URL` that can be imported from [`svelte/reactivity`](svelte-reactivity).\n\n## `$state.raw`\n\nIn cases where you don't want objects and arrays to be deeply reactive you can use `$state.raw`.\n\nState declared with `$state.raw` cannot be mutated; it can only be _reassigned_. In other words, rather than assigning to a property of an object, or using an array method like `push`, replace the object or array altogether if you'd like to update it:\n\n```js\nlet person = $state.raw({\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 49\n});\n\n// this will have no effect\nperson.age += 1;\n\n// this will work, because we're creating a new person\nperson = {\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 50\n};\n```\n\nThis can improve performance with large arrays and objects that you weren't planning to mutate anyway, since it avoids the cost of making them reactive. Note that raw state can _contain_ reactive state (for example, a raw array of reactive objects).\n\nAs with `$state`, you can declare class fields using `$state.raw`.\n\n## `$state.snapshot`\n\nTo take a static snapshot of a deeply reactive `$state` proxy, use `$state.snapshot`:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet counter = $state({ count: 0 });\n\n\tfunction onclick() {\n\t\t// Will log `{ count: ... }` rather than `Proxy { ... }`\n\t\tconsole.log($state.snapshot(counter));\n\t}\n</script>\n```\n\nThis is handy when you want to pass some state to an external library or API that doesn't expect a proxy, such as `structuredClone`.\n\n## `$state.eager`\n\nWhen state changes, it may not be reflected in the UI immediately if it is used by an `await` expression, because [updates are synchronized](await-expressions#Synchronized-updates).\n\nIn some cases, you may want to update the UI as soon as the state changes. For example, you might want to update a navigation bar when the user clicks on a link, so that they get visual feedback while waiting for the new page to load. To do this, use `$state.eager(value)`:\n\n```svelte\n<nav>\n\t<a href=\"/\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/' ? 'page' : null}>home</a>\n\t<a href=\"/about\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/about' ? 'page' : null}>about</a>\n</nav>\n```\n\nUse this feature sparingly, and only to provide feedback in response to user action — in general, allowing Svelte to coordinate updates will provide a better user experience.\n\n## Passing state into functions\n\nJavaScript is a _pass-by-value_ language — when you call a function, the arguments are the _values_ rather than the _variables_. In other words:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {number} a\n * @param {number} b\n */\nfunction add(a, b) {\n\treturn a + b;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add(a, b);\nconsole.log(total); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(total); // still 3!\n```\n\nIf `add` wanted to have access to the _current_ values of `a` and `b`, and to return the current `total` value, you would need to use functions instead:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {() => number} getA\n * @param {() => number} getB\n */\nfunction add(+++getA, getB+++) {\n\treturn +++() => getA() + getB()+++;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add+++(() => a, () => b)+++;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 7\n```\n\nState in Svelte is no different — when you reference something declared with the `$state` rune...\n\n```js\nlet a = +++$state(1)+++;\nlet b = +++$state(2)+++;\n```\n\n...you're accessing its _current value_.\n\nNote that 'functions' is broad — it encompasses properties of proxies and [`get`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get)/[`set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) properties...\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {{ a: number, b: number }} input\n */\nfunction add(input) {\n\treturn {\n\t\tget value() {\n\t\t\treturn input.a + input.b;\n\t\t}\n\t};\n}\n\nlet input = $state({ a: 1, b: 2 });\nlet total = add(input);\nconsole.log(total.value); // 3\n\ninput.a = 3;\ninput.b = 4;\nconsole.log(total.value); // 7\n```\n\n...though if you find yourself writing code like that, consider using [classes](#Classes) instead.\n\n## Passing state across modules\n\nYou can declare state in `.svelte.js` and `.svelte.ts` files, but you can only _export_ that state if it's not directly reassigned. In other words you can't do this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = $state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\nThat's because every reference to `count` is transformed by the Svelte compiler — the code above is roughly equivalent to this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js (compiler output)\n// @filename: index.ts\ninterface Signal<T> {\n\tvalue: T;\n}\n\ninterface Svelte {\n\tstate<T>(value?: T): Signal<T>;\n\tget<T>(source: Signal<T>): T;\n\tset<T>(source: Signal<T>, value: T): void;\n}\ndeclare const $: Svelte;\n// ---cut---\nexport let count = $.state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\t$.set(count, $.get(count) + 1);\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] You can see the code Svelte generates by clicking the 'JS Output' tab in the [playground](/playground).\n\nSince the compiler only operates on one file at a time, if another file imports `count` Svelte doesn't know that it needs to wrap each reference in `$.get` and `$.set`:\n\n```js\n// @filename: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = 0;\n\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\nimport { count } from './state.svelte.js';\n\nconsole.log(typeof count); // 'object', not 'number'\n```\n\nThis leaves you with two options for sharing state between modules — either don't reassign it...\n\n```js\n// This is allowed — since we're updating\n// `counter.count` rather than `counter`,\n// Svelte doesn't wrap it in `$.state`\nexport const counter = $state({\n\tcount: 0\n});\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcounter.count += 1;\n}\n```\n\n...or don't directly export it:\n\n```js\nlet count = $state(0);\n\nexport function getCount() {\n\treturn count;\n}\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```"

Svelte will disallow state changes (e.g. `count++`) inside derived expressions.\n\nAs with `$state`, you can mark class fields as `$derived`.\n\n> [!NOTE] Code in Svelte components is only executed once at creation. Without the `$derived` rune, `doubled` would maintain its original value even when `count` changes.\n\n## `$derived.by`\n\nSometimes you need to create complex derivations that don't fit inside a short expression. In these cases, you can use `$derived.by` which accepts a function as its argument.\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet numbers = $state([1, 2, 3]);\n\tlet total = $derived.by(() => {\n\t\tlet total = 0;\n\t\tfor (const n of numbers) {\n\t\t\ttotal += n;\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn total;\n\t});\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => numbers.push(numbers.length + 1)}>\n\t{numbers.join(' + ')} = {total}\n</button>\n```\n\nIn essence, `$derived(expression)` is equivalent to `$derived.by(() => expression)`.\n\n## Understanding dependencies\n\nAnything read synchronously inside the `$derived` expression (or `$derived.by` function body) is considered a _dependency_ of the derived state. When the state changes, the derived will be marked as _dirty_ and recalculated when it is next read.\n\nTo exempt a piece of state from being treated as a dependency, use [`untrack`](svelte#untrack).\n\n## Overriding derived values\n\nDerived expressions are recalculated when their dependencies change, but you can temporarily override their values by reassigning them (unless they are declared with `const`). This can be useful for things like _optimistic UI_, where a value is derived from the 'source of truth' (such as data from your server) but you'd like to show immediate feedback to the user:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet { post, like } = $props();\n\n\tlet likes = $derived(post.likes);\n\n\tasync function onclick() {\n\t\t// increment the `likes` count immediately...\n\t\tlikes += 1;\n\n\t\t// and tell the server, which will eventually update `post`\n\t\ttry {\n\t\t\tawait like();\n\t\t} catch {\n\t\t\t// failed! roll back the change\n\t\t\tlikes -= 1;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n</script>\n\n<button {onclick}>🧡 {likes}</button>\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] Prior to Svelte 5.25, deriveds were read-only.\n\n## Deriveds and reactivity\n\nUnlike `$state`, which converts objects and arrays to [deeply reactive proxies]($state#Deep-state), `$derived` values are left as-is. For example, [in a case like this](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE4VU22rjMBD9lUHd3aaQi9PdstS1A3t5XvpQ2Ic4D7I1iUUV2UjjNMX431eS7TRdSosxgjMzZ45mjt0yzffIYibvy0ojFJWqDKCQVBk2ZVup0LJ43TJ6rn2aBxw-FP2o67k9oCKP5dziW3hRaUJNjoYltjCyplWmM1JIIAn3FlL4ZIkTTtYez6jtj4w8WwyXv9GiIXiQxLVs9pfTMR7EuoSLIuLFbX7Z4930bZo_nBrD1bs834tlfvsBz9_SyX6PZXu9XaL4gOWn4sXjeyzftv4ZWfyxubpzxzg6LfD4MrooxELEosKCUPigQCMPKCZh0OtQE1iSxcsmdHuBvCiHZXALLXiN08EL3RRkaJ_kDVGle0HcSD5TPEeVtj67O4Nrg9aiSNtBY5oODJkrL5QsHtN2cgXp6nSJMWzpWWGasdlsGEMbzi5jPr5KFr0Ep7pdeM2-TCelCddIhDxAobi1jqF3cMaC1RKp64bAW9iFAmXGIHfd4wNXDabtOLN53w8W53VvJoZLh7xk4Rr3CoL-UNoLhWHrT1JQGcM17u96oES5K-kc2XOzkzqGCKL5De79OUTyyrg1zgwXsrEx3ESfx4Bz0M5UjVMHB24mw9SuXtXFoN13fYKOM1tyUT3FbvbWmSWCZX2Er-41u5xPoml45svRahl9Wb9aasbINJixDZwcPTbyTLZSUsAvrg_cPuCR7s782_WU8343Y72Qtlb8OYatwuOQvuN13M_hJKNfxann1v1U_B1KZ_D_mzhzhz24fw85CSz2irtN9w9HshBK7AQAAA==)...\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7005\nlet items = $state([ /*...*/ ]);\n\nlet index = $state(0);\nlet selected = $derived(items[index]);\n```\n\n...you can change (or `bind:` to) properties of `selected` and it will affect the underlying `items` array. If `items` was _not_ deeply reactive, mutating `selected` would have no effect.\n\n## Destructuring\n\nIf you use destructuring with a `$derived` declaration, the resulting variables will all be reactive — this...\n\n```js\nfunction stuff() { return { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 } }\n// ---cut---\nlet { a, b, c } = $derived(stuff());\n```\n\n...is roughly equivalent to this:\n\n```js\nfunction stuff() { return { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 } }\n// ---cut---\nlet _stuff = $derived(stuff());\nlet a = $derived(_stuff.a);\nlet b = $derived(_stuff.b);\nlet c = $derived(_stuff.c);\n```\n\n## Update propagation\n\nSvelte uses something called _push-pull reactivity_ — when state is updated, everything that depends on the state (whether directly or indirectly) is immediately notified of the change (the 'push'), but derived values are not re-evaluated until they are actually read (the 'pull').\n\nIf the new value of a derived is referentially identical to its previous value, downstream updates will be skipped. In other words, Svelte will only update the text inside the button when `large` changes, not when `count` changes, even though `large` depends on `count`:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet count = $state(0);\n\tlet large = $derived(count > 10);\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => count++}>\n\t{large}\n</button>\n```\n\n---\n\n## $state\n\nThe `$state` rune allows you to create _reactive state_, which means that your UI _reacts_ when it changes.\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet count = $state(0);\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => count++}>\n\tclicks: {count}\n</button>\n```\n\nUnlike other frameworks you may have encountered, there is no API for interacting with state — `count` is just a number, rather than an object or a function, and you can update it like you would update any other variable.\n\n### Deep state\n\nIf `$state` is used with an array or a simple object, the result is a deeply reactive _state proxy_. [Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) allow Svelte to run code when you read or write properties, including via methods like `array.push(...)`, triggering granular updates.\n\nState is proxified recursively until Svelte finds something other than an array or simple object (like a class or an object created with `Object.create`). In a case like this...\n\n```js\nlet todos = $state([\n\t{\n\t\tdone: false,\n\t\ttext: 'add more todos'\n\t}\n]);\n```\n\n...modifying an individual todo's property will trigger updates to anything in your UI that depends on that specific property:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\nIf you push a new object to the array, it will also be proxified:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos.push({\n\tdone: false,\n\ttext: 'eat lunch'\n});\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] When you update properties of proxies, the original object is _not_ mutated. If you need to use your own proxy handlers in a state proxy, [you should wrap the object _after_ wrapping it in `$state`](https://svelte.dev/playground/hello-world?version=latest#H4sIAAAAAAAACpWR3WoDIRCFX2UqhWyIJL3erAulL9C7XnQLMe5ksbUqOpsfln33YuyGFNJC8UKdc2bOhw7Myk9kJXsJ0nttO9jcR5KEG9AWJDwHdzwxznbaYGTl68Do5JM_FRifuh-9X8Y9Gkq1rYx4q66cJbQUWcmqqIL2VDe2IYMEbvuOikBADi-GJDSkXG-phId0G-frye2DO2psQYDFQ0Ys8gQO350dUkEydEg82T0GOs0nsSG9g2IqgxACZueo2ZUlpdvoDC6N64qsg1QKY8T2bpZp8gpIfbCQ85Zn50Ud82HkeY83uDjspenxv3jXcSDyjPWf9L1vJf0GH666J-jLu1ery4dV257IWXBWGa0-xFDMQdTTn2ScxWKsn86ROsLwQxqrVR5QM84Ij8TKFD2-cUZSm4O2LSt30kQcvwCgCmfZnAIAAA==).\n\nNote that if you destructure a reactive value, the references are not reactive — as in normal JavaScript, they are evaluated at the point of destructuring:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\nlet { done, text } = todos[0];\n\n// this will not affect the value of `done`\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\n### Classes\n\nClass instances are not proxied. Instead, you can use `$state` in class fields (whether public or private), or as the first assignment to a property immediately inside the `constructor`:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\treset() {\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] The compiler transforms `done` and `text` into `get`/`set` methods on the class prototype referencing private fields. This means the properties are not enumerable.\n\nWhen calling methods in JavaScript, the value of [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) matters. This won't work, because `this` inside the `reset` method will be the `<button>` rather than the `Todo`:\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick={todo.reset}>\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\nYou can either use an inline function...\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick=+++{() => todo.reset()}>+++\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\n...or use an arrow function in the class definition:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\t+++reset = () => {+++\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Built-in classes\n\nSvelte provides reactive implementations of built-in classes like `Set`, `Map`, `Date` and `URL` that can be imported from [`svelte/reactivity`](svelte-reactivity).\n\n## `$state.raw`\n\nIn cases where you don't want objects and arrays to be deeply reactive you can use `$state.raw`.\n\nState declared with `$state.raw` cannot be mutated; it can only be _reassigned_. In other words, rather than assigning to a property of an object, or using an array method like `push`, replace the object or array altogether if you'd like to update it:\n\n```js\nlet person = $state.raw({\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 49\n});\n\n// this will have no effect\nperson.age += 1;\n\n// this will work, because we're creating a new person\nperson = {\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 50\n};\n```\n\nThis can improve performance with large arrays and objects that you weren't planning to mutate anyway, since it avoids the cost of making them reactive. Note that raw state can _contain_ reactive state (for example, a raw array of reactive objects).\n\nAs with `$state`, you can declare class fields using `$state.raw`.\n\n## `$state.snapshot`\n\nTo take a static snapshot of a deeply reactive `$state` proxy, use `$state.snapshot`:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet counter = $state({ count: 0 });\n\n\tfunction onclick() {\n\t\t// Will log `{ count: ... }` rather than `Proxy { ... }`\n\t\tconsole.log($state.snapshot(counter));\n\t}\n</script>\n```\n\nThis is handy when you want to pass some state to an external library or API that doesn't expect a proxy, such as `structuredClone`.\n\n## `$state.eager`\n\nWhen state changes, it may not be reflected in the UI immediately if it is used by an `await` expression, because [updates are synchronized](await-expressions#Synchronized-updates).\n\nIn some cases, you may want to update the UI as soon as the state changes. For example, you might want to update a navigation bar when the user clicks on a link, so that they get visual feedback while waiting for the new page to load. To do this, use `$state.eager(value)`:\n\n```svelte\n<nav>\n\t<a href=\"/\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/' ? 'page' : null}>home</a>\n\t<a href=\"/about\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/about' ? 'page' : null}>about</a>\n</nav>\n```\n\nUse this feature sparingly, and only to provide feedback in response to user action — in general, allowing Svelte to coordinate updates will provide a better user experience.\n\n## Passing state into functions\n\nJavaScript is a _pass-by-value_ language — when you call a function, the arguments are the _values_ rather than the _variables_. In other words:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {number} a\n * @param {number} b\n */\nfunction add(a, b) {\n\treturn a + b;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add(a, b);\nconsole.log(total); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(total); // still 3!\n```\n\nIf `add` wanted to have access to the _current_ values of `a` and `b`, and to return the current `total` value, you would need to use functions instead:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {() => number} getA\n * @param {() => number} getB\n */\nfunction add(+++getA, getB+++) {\n\treturn +++() => getA() + getB()+++;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add+++(() => a, () => b)+++;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 7\n```\n\nState in Svelte is no different — when you reference something declared with the `$state` rune...\n\n```js\nlet a = +++$state(1)+++;\nlet b = +++$state(2)+++;\n```\n\n...you're accessing its _current value_.\n\nNote that 'functions' is broad — it encompasses properties of proxies and [`get`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get)/[`set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) properties...\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {{ a: number, b: number }} input\n */\nfunction add(input) {\n\treturn {\n\t\tget value() {\n\t\t\treturn input.a + input.b;\n\t\t}\n\t};\n}\n\nlet input = $state({ a: 1, b: 2 });\nlet total = add(input);\nconsole.log(total.value); // 3\n\ninput.a = 3;\ninput.b = 4;\nconsole.log(total.value); // 7\n```\n\n...though if you find yourself writing code like that, consider using [classes](#Classes) instead.\n\n## Passing state across modules\n\nYou can declare state in `.svelte.js` and `.svelte.ts` files, but you can only _export_ that state if it's not directly reassigned. In other words you can't do this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = $state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\nThat's because every reference to `count` is transformed by the Svelte compiler — the code above is roughly equivalent to this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js (compiler output)\n// @filename: index.ts\ninterface Signal<T> {\n\tvalue: T;\n}\n\ninterface Svelte {\n\tstate<T>(value?: T): Signal<T>;\n\tget<T>(source: Signal<T>): T;\n\tset<T>(source: Signal<T>, value: T): void;\n}\ndeclare const $: Svelte;\n// ---cut---\nexport let count = $.state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\t$.set(count, $.get(count) + 1);\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] You can see the code Svelte generates by clicking the 'JS Output' tab in the [playground](/playground).\n\nSince the compiler only operates on one file at a time, if another file imports `count` Svelte doesn't know that it needs to wrap each reference in `$.get` and `$.set`:\n\n```js\n// @filename: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = 0;\n\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\nimport { count } from './state.svelte.js';\n\nconsole.log(typeof count); // 'object', not 'number'\n```\n\nThis leaves you with two options for sharing state between modules — either don't reassign it...\n\n```js\n// This is allowed — since we're updating\n// `counter.count` rather than `counter`,\n// Svelte doesn't wrap it in `$.state`\nexport const counter = $state({\n\tcount: 0\n});\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcounter.count += 1;\n}\n```\n\n...or don't directly export it:\n\n```js\nlet count = $state(0);\n\nexport function getCount() {\n\treturn count;\n}\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```"

Svelte will disallow state changes (e.g. `count++`) inside derived expressions.\n\nAs with `$state`, you can mark class fields as `$derived`.\n\n> [!NOTE] Code in Svelte components is only executed once at creation. Without the `$derived` rune, `doubled` would maintain its original value even when `count` changes.\n\n## `$derived.by`\n\nSometimes you need to create complex derivations that don't fit inside a short expression. In these cases, you can use `$derived.by` which accepts a function as its argument.\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet numbers = $state([1, 2, 3]);\n\tlet total = $derived.by(() => {\n\t\tlet total = 0;\n\t\tfor (const n of numbers) {\n\t\t\ttotal += n;\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn total;\n\t});\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => numbers.push(numbers.length + 1)}>\n\t{numbers.join(' + ')} = {total}\n</button>\n```\n\nIn essence, `$derived(expression)` is equivalent to `$derived.by(() => expression)`.\n\n## Understanding dependencies\n\nAnything read synchronously inside the `$derived` expression (or `$derived.by` function body) is considered a _dependency_ of the derived state. When the state changes, the derived will be marked as _dirty_ and recalculated when it is next read.\n\nTo exempt a piece of state from being treated as a dependency, use [`untrack`](svelte#untrack).\n\n## Overriding derived values\n\nDerived expressions are recalculated when their dependencies change, but you can temporarily override their values by reassigning them (unless they are declared with `const`). This can be useful for things like _optimistic UI_, where a value is derived from the 'source of truth' (such as data from your server) but you'd like to show immediate feedback to the user:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet { post, like } = $props();\n\n\tlet likes = $derived(post.likes);\n\n\tasync function onclick() {\n\t\t// increment the `likes` count immediately...\n\t\tlikes += 1;\n\n\t\t// and tell the server, which will eventually update `post`\n\t\ttry {\n\t\t\tawait like();\n\t\t} catch {\n\t\t\t// failed! roll back the change\n\t\t\tlikes -= 1;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n</script>\n\n<button {onclick}>🧡 {likes}</button>\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] Prior to Svelte 5.25, deriveds were read-only.\n\n## Deriveds and reactivity\n\nUnlike `$state`, which converts objects and arrays to [deeply reactive proxies]($state#Deep-state), `$derived` values are left as-is. For example, [in a case like this](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE4VU22rjMBD9lUHd3aaQi9PdstS1A3t5XvpQ2Ic4D7I1iUUV2UjjNMX431eS7TRdSosxgjMzZ45mjt0yzffIYibvy0ojFJWqDKCQVBk2ZVup0LJ43TJ6rn2aBxw-FP2o67k9oCKP5dziW3hRaUJNjoYltjCyplWmM1JIIAn3FlL4ZIkTTtYez6jtj4w8WwyXv9GiIXiQxLVs9pfTMR7EuoSLIuLFbX7Z4930bZo_nBrD1bs834tlfvsBz9_SyX6PZXu9XaL4gOWn4sXjeyzftv4ZWfyxubpzxzg6LfD4MrooxELEosKCUPigQCMPKCZh0OtQE1iSxcsmdHuBvCiHZXALLXiN08EL3RRkaJ_kDVGle0HcSD5TPEeVtj67O4Nrg9aiSNtBY5oODJkrL5QsHtN2cgXp6nSJMWzpWWGasdlsGEMbzi5jPr5KFr0Ep7pdeM2-TCelCddIhDxAobi1jqF3cMaC1RKp64bAW9iFAmXGIHfd4wNXDabtOLN53w8W53VvJoZLh7xk4Rr3CoL-UNoLhWHrT1JQGcM17u96oES5K-kc2XOzkzqGCKL5De79OUTyyrg1zgwXsrEx3ESfx4Bz0M5UjVMHB24mw9SuXtXFoN13fYKOM1tyUT3FbvbWmSWCZX2Er-41u5xPoml45svRahl9Wb9aasbINJixDZwcPTbyTLZSUsAvrg_cPuCR7s782_WU8343Y72Qtlb8OYatwuOQvuN13M_hJKNfxann1v1U_B1KZ_D_mzhzhz24fw85CSz2irtN9w9HshBK7AQAAA==)...\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7005\nlet items = $state([ /*...*/ ]);\n\nlet index = $state(0);\nlet selected = $derived(items[index]);\n```\n\n...you can change (or `bind:` to) properties of `selected` and it will affect the underlying `items` array. If `items` was _not_ deeply reactive, mutating `selected` would have no effect.\n\n## Destructuring\n\nIf you use destructuring with a `$derived` declaration, the resulting variables will all be reactive — this...\n\n```js\nfunction stuff() { return { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 } }\n// ---cut---\nlet { a, b, c } = $derived(stuff());\n```\n\n...is roughly equivalent to this:\n\n```js\nfunction stuff() { return { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 } }\n// ---cut---\nlet _stuff = $derived(stuff());\nlet a = $derived(_stuff.a);\nlet b = $derived(_stuff.b);\nlet c = $derived(_stuff.c);\n```\n\n## Update propagation\n\nSvelte uses something called _push-pull reactivity_ — when state is updated, everything that depends on the state (whether directly or indirectly) is immediately notified of the change (the 'push'), but derived values are not re-evaluated until they are actually read (the 'pull').\n\nIf the new value of a derived is referentially identical to its previous value, downstream updates will be skipped. In other words, Svelte will only update the text inside the button when `large` changes, not when `count` changes, even though `large` depends on `count`:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet count = $state(0);\n\tlet large = $derived(count > 10);\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => count++}>\n\t{large}\n</button>\n```\n\n---\n\n## $state\n\nThe `$state` rune allows you to create _reactive state_, which means that your UI _reacts_ when it changes.\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet count = $state(0);\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => count++}>\n\tclicks: {count}\n</button>\n```\n\nUnlike other frameworks you may have encountered, there is no API for interacting with state — `count` is just a number, rather than an object or a function, and you can update it like you would update any other variable.\n\n### Deep state\n\nIf `$state` is used with an array or a simple object, the result is a deeply reactive _state proxy_. [Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) allow Svelte to run code when you read or write properties, including via methods like `array.push(...)`, triggering granular updates.\n\nState is proxified recursively until Svelte finds something other than an array or simple object (like a class or an object created with `Object.create`). In a case like this...\n\n```js\nlet todos = $state([\n\t{\n\t\tdone: false,\n\t\ttext: 'add more todos'\n\t}\n]);\n```\n\n...modifying an individual todo's property will trigger updates to anything in your UI that depends on that specific property:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\nIf you push a new object to the array, it will also be proxified:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos.push({\n\tdone: false,\n\ttext: 'eat lunch'\n});\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] When you update properties of proxies, the original object is _not_ mutated. If you need to use your own proxy handlers in a state proxy, [you should wrap the object _after_ wrapping it in `$state`](https://svelte.dev/playground/hello-world?version=latest#H4sIAAAAAAAACpWR3WoDIRCFX2UqhWyIJL3erAulL9C7XnQLMe5ksbUqOpsfln33YuyGFNJC8UKdc2bOhw7Myk9kJXsJ0nttO9jcR5KEG9AWJDwHdzwxznbaYGTl68Do5JM_FRifuh-9X8Y9Gkq1rYx4q66cJbQUWcmqqIL2VDe2IYMEbvuOikBADi-GJDSkXG-phId0G-frye2DO2psQYDFQ0Ys8gQO350dUkEydEg82T0GOs0nsSG9g2IqgxACZueo2ZUlpdvoDC6N64qsg1QKY8T2bpZp8gpIfbCQ85Zn50Ud82HkeY83uDjspenxv3jXcSDyjPWf9L1vJf0GH666J-jLu1ery4dV257IWXBWGa0-xFDMQdTTn2ScxWKsn86ROsLwQxqrVR5QM84Ij8TKFD2-cUZSm4O2LSt30kQcvwCgCmfZnAIAAA==).\n\nNote that if you destructure a reactive value, the references are not reactive — as in normal JavaScript, they are evaluated at the point of destructuring:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\nlet { done, text } = todos[0];\n\n// this will not affect the value of `done`\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\n### Classes\n\nClass instances are not proxied. Instead, you can use `$state` in class fields (whether public or private), or as the first assignment to a property immediately inside the `constructor`:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\treset() {\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] The compiler transforms `done` and `text` into `get`/`set` methods on the class prototype referencing private fields. This means the properties are not enumerable.\n\nWhen calling methods in JavaScript, the value of [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) matters. This won't work, because `this` inside the `reset` method will be the `<button>` rather than the `Todo`:\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick={todo.reset}>\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\nYou can either use an inline function...\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick=+++{() => todo.reset()}>+++\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\n...or use an arrow function in the class definition:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\t+++reset = () => {+++\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Built-in classes\n\nSvelte provides reactive implementations of built-in classes like `Set`, `Map`, `Date` and `URL` that can be imported from [`svelte/reactivity`](svelte-reactivity).\n\n## `$state.raw`\n\nIn cases where you don't want objects and arrays to be deeply reactive you can use `$state.raw`.\n\nState declared with `$state.raw` cannot be mutated; it can only be _reassigned_. In other words, rather than assigning to a property of an object, or using an array method like `push`, replace the object or array altogether if you'd like to update it:\n\n```js\nlet person = $state.raw({\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 49\n});\n\n// this will have no effect\nperson.age += 1;\n\n// this will work, because we're creating a new person\nperson = {\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 50\n};\n```\n\nThis can improve performance with large arrays and objects that you weren't planning to mutate anyway, since it avoids the cost of making them reactive. Note that raw state can _contain_ reactive state (for example, a raw array of reactive objects).\n\nAs with `$state`, you can declare class fields using `$state.raw`.\n\n## `$state.snapshot`\n\nTo take a static snapshot of a deeply reactive `$state` proxy, use `$state.snapshot`:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet counter = $state({ count: 0 });\n\n\tfunction onclick() {\n\t\t// Will log `{ count: ... }` rather than `Proxy { ... }`\n\t\tconsole.log($state.snapshot(counter));\n\t}\n</script>\n```\n\nThis is handy when you want to pass some state to an external library or API that doesn't expect a proxy, such as `structuredClone`.\n\n## `$state.eager`\n\nWhen state changes, it may not be reflected in the UI immediately if it is used by an `await` expression, because [updates are synchronized](await-expressions#Synchronized-updates).\n\nIn some cases, you may want to update the UI as soon as the state changes. For example, you might want to update a navigation bar when the user clicks on a link, so that they get visual feedback while waiting for the new page to load. To do this, use `$state.eager(value)`:\n\n```svelte\n<nav>\n\t<a href=\"/\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/' ? 'page' : null}>home</a>\n\t<a href=\"/about\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/about' ? 'page' : null}>about</a>\n</nav>\n```\n\nUse this feature sparingly, and only to provide feedback in response to user action — in general, allowing Svelte to coordinate updates will provide a better user experience.\n\n## Passing state into functions\n\nJavaScript is a _pass-by-value_ language — when you call a function, the arguments are the _values_ rather than the _variables_. In other words:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {number} a\n * @param {number} b\n */\nfunction add(a, b) {\n\treturn a + b;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add(a, b);\nconsole.log(total); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(total); // still 3!\n```\n\nIf `add` wanted to have access to the _current_ values of `a` and `b`, and to return the current `total` value, you would need to use functions instead:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {() => number} getA\n * @param {() => number} getB\n */\nfunction add(+++getA, getB+++) {\n\treturn +++() => getA() + getB()+++;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add+++(() => a, () => b)+++;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 7\n```\n\nState in Svelte is no different — when you reference something declared with the `$state` rune...\n\n```js\nlet a = +++$state(1)+++;\nlet b = +++$state(2)+++;\n```\n\n...you're accessing its _current value_.\n\nNote that 'functions' is broad — it encompasses properties of proxies and [`get`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get)/[`set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) properties...\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {{ a: number, b: number }} input\n */\nfunction add(input) {\n\treturn {\n\t\tget value() {\n\t\t\treturn input.a + input.b;\n\t\t}\n\t};\n}\n\nlet input = $state({ a: 1, b: 2 });\nlet total = add(input);\nconsole.log(total.value); // 3\n\ninput.a = 3;\ninput.b = 4;\nconsole.log(total.value); // 7\n```\n\n...though if you find yourself writing code like that, consider using [classes](#Classes) instead.\n\n## Passing state across modules\n\nYou can declare state in `.svelte.js` and `.svelte.ts` files, but you can only _export_ that state if it's not directly reassigned. In other words you can't do this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = $state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\nThat's because every reference to `count` is transformed by the Svelte compiler — the code above is roughly equivalent to this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js (compiler output)\n// @filename: index.ts\ninterface Signal<T> {\n\tvalue: T;\n}\n\ninterface Svelte {\n\tstate<T>(value?: T): Signal<T>;\n\tget<T>(source: Signal<T>): T;\n\tset<T>(source: Signal<T>, value: T): void;\n}\ndeclare const $: Svelte;\n// ---cut---\nexport let count = $.state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\t$.set(count, $.get(count) + 1);\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] You can see the code Svelte generates by clicking the 'JS Output' tab in the [playground](/playground).\n\nSince the compiler only operates on one file at a time, if another file imports `count` Svelte doesn't know that it needs to wrap each reference in `$.get` and `$.set`:\n\n```js\n// @filename: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = 0;\n\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\nimport { count } from './state.svelte.js';\n\nconsole.log(typeof count); // 'object', not 'number'\n```\n\nThis leaves you with two options for sharing state between modules — either don't reassign it...\n\n```js\n// This is allowed — since we're updating\n// `counter.count` rather than `counter`,\n// Svelte doesn't wrap it in `$.state`\nexport const counter = $state({\n\tcount: 0\n});\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcounter.count += 1;\n}\n```\n\n...or don't directly export it:\n\n```js\nlet count = $state(0);\n\nexport function getCount() {\n\treturn count;\n}\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```"

In these cases, you can use `$derived.by` which accepts a function as its argument.\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet numbers = $state([1, 2, 3]);\n\tlet total = $derived.by(() => {\n\t\tlet total = 0;\n\t\tfor (const n of numbers) {\n\t\t\ttotal += n;\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn total;\n\t});\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => numbers.push(numbers.length + 1)}>\n\t{numbers.join(' + ')} = {total}\n</button>\n```\n\nIn essence, `$derived(expression)` is equivalent to `$derived.by(() => expression)`.\n\n## Understanding dependencies\n\nAnything read synchronously inside the `$derived` expression (or `$derived.by` function body) is considered a _dependency_ of the derived state. When the state changes, the derived will be marked as _dirty_ and recalculated when it is next read.\n\nTo exempt a piece of state from being treated as a dependency, use [`untrack`](svelte#untrack).\n\n## Overriding derived values\n\nDerived expressions are recalculated when their dependencies change, but you can temporarily override their values by reassigning them (unless they are declared with `const`). This can be useful for things like _optimistic UI_, where a value is derived from the 'source of truth' (such as data from your server) but you'd like to show immediate feedback to the user:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet { post, like } = $props();\n\n\tlet likes = $derived(post.likes);\n\n\tasync function onclick() {\n\t\t// increment the `likes` count immediately...\n\t\tlikes += 1;\n\n\t\t// and tell the server, which will eventually update `post`\n\t\ttry {\n\t\t\tawait like();\n\t\t} catch {\n\t\t\t// failed! roll back the change\n\t\t\tlikes -= 1;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n</script>\n\n<button {onclick}>🧡 {likes}</button>\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] Prior to Svelte 5.25, deriveds were read-only.\n\n## Deriveds and reactivity\n\nUnlike `$state`, which converts objects and arrays to [deeply reactive proxies]($state#Deep-state), `$derived` values are left as-is. For example, [in a case like this](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE4VU22rjMBD9lUHd3aaQi9PdstS1A3t5XvpQ2Ic4D7I1iUUV2UjjNMX431eS7TRdSosxgjMzZ45mjt0yzffIYibvy0ojFJWqDKCQVBk2ZVup0LJ43TJ6rn2aBxw-FP2o67k9oCKP5dziW3hRaUJNjoYltjCyplWmM1JIIAn3FlL4ZIkTTtYez6jtj4w8WwyXv9GiIXiQxLVs9pfTMR7EuoSLIuLFbX7Z4930bZo_nBrD1bs834tlfvsBz9_SyX6PZXu9XaL4gOWn4sXjeyzftv4ZWfyxubpzxzg6LfD4MrooxELEosKCUPigQCMPKCZh0OtQE1iSxcsmdHuBvCiHZXALLXiN08EL3RRkaJ_kDVGle0HcSD5TPEeVtj67O4Nrg9aiSNtBY5oODJkrL5QsHtN2cgXp6nSJMWzpWWGasdlsGEMbzi5jPr5KFr0Ep7pdeM2-TCelCddIhDxAobi1jqF3cMaC1RKp64bAW9iFAmXGIHfd4wNXDabtOLN53w8W53VvJoZLh7xk4Rr3CoL-UNoLhWHrT1JQGcM17u96oES5K-kc2XOzkzqGCKL5De79OUTyyrg1zgwXsrEx3ESfx4Bz0M5UjVMHB24mw9SuXtXFoN13fYKOM1tyUT3FbvbWmSWCZX2Er-41u5xPoml45svRahl9Wb9aasbINJixDZwcPTbyTLZSUsAvrg_cPuCR7s782_WU8343Y72Qtlb8OYatwuOQvuN13M_hJKNfxann1v1U_B1KZ_D_mzhzhz24fw85CSz2irtN9w9HshBK7AQAAA==)...\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7005\nlet items = $state([ /*...*/ ]);\n\nlet index = $state(0);\nlet selected = $derived(items[index]);\n```\n\n...you can change (or `bind:` to) properties of `selected` and it will affect the underlying `items` array. If `items` was _not_ deeply reactive, mutating `selected` would have no effect.\n\n## Destructuring\n\nIf you use destructuring with a `$derived` declaration, the resulting variables will all be reactive — this...\n\n```js\nfunction stuff() { return { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 } }\n// ---cut---\nlet { a, b, c } = $derived(stuff());\n```\n\n...is roughly equivalent to this:\n\n```js\nfunction stuff() { return { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 } }\n// ---cut---\nlet _stuff = $derived(stuff());\nlet a = $derived(_stuff.a);\nlet b = $derived(_stuff.b);\nlet c = $derived(_stuff.c);\n```\n\n## Update propagation\n\nSvelte uses something called _push-pull reactivity_ — when state is updated, everything that depends on the state (whether directly or indirectly) is immediately notified of the change (the 'push'), but derived values are not re-evaluated until they are actually read (the 'pull').\n\nIf the new value of a derived is referentially identical to its previous value, downstream updates will be skipped. In other words, Svelte will only update the text inside the button when `large` changes, not when `count` changes, even though `large` depends on `count`:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet count = $state(0);\n\tlet large = $derived(count > 10);\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => count++}>\n\t{large}\n</button>\n```\n\n---\n\n## $state\n\nThe `$state` rune allows you to create _reactive state_, which means that your UI _reacts_ when it changes.\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet count = $state(0);\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => count++}>\n\tclicks: {count}\n</button>\n```\n\nUnlike other frameworks you may have encountered, there is no API for interacting with state — `count` is just a number, rather than an object or a function, and you can update it like you would update any other variable.\n\n### Deep state\n\nIf `$state` is used with an array or a simple object, the result is a deeply reactive _state proxy_. [Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) allow Svelte to run code when you read or write properties, including via methods like `array.push(...)`, triggering granular updates.\n\nState is proxified recursively until Svelte finds something other than an array or simple object (like a class or an object created with `Object.create`). In a case like this...\n\n```js\nlet todos = $state([\n\t{\n\t\tdone: false,\n\t\ttext: 'add more todos'\n\t}\n]);\n```\n\n...modifying an individual todo's property will trigger updates to anything in your UI that depends on that specific property:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\nIf you push a new object to the array, it will also be proxified:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos.push({\n\tdone: false,\n\ttext: 'eat lunch'\n});\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] When you update properties of proxies, the original object is _not_ mutated. If you need to use your own proxy handlers in a state proxy, [you should wrap the object _after_ wrapping it in `$state`](https://svelte.dev/playground/hello-world?version=latest#H4sIAAAAAAAACpWR3WoDIRCFX2UqhWyIJL3erAulL9C7XnQLMe5ksbUqOpsfln33YuyGFNJC8UKdc2bOhw7Myk9kJXsJ0nttO9jcR5KEG9AWJDwHdzwxznbaYGTl68Do5JM_FRifuh-9X8Y9Gkq1rYx4q66cJbQUWcmqqIL2VDe2IYMEbvuOikBADi-GJDSkXG-phId0G-frye2DO2psQYDFQ0Ys8gQO350dUkEydEg82T0GOs0nsSG9g2IqgxACZueo2ZUlpdvoDC6N64qsg1QKY8T2bpZp8gpIfbCQ85Zn50Ud82HkeY83uDjspenxv3jXcSDyjPWf9L1vJf0GH666J-jLu1ery4dV257IWXBWGa0-xFDMQdTTn2ScxWKsn86ROsLwQxqrVR5QM84Ij8TKFD2-cUZSm4O2LSt30kQcvwCgCmfZnAIAAA==).\n\nNote that if you destructure a reactive value, the references are not reactive — as in normal JavaScript, they are evaluated at the point of destructuring:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\nlet { done, text } = todos[0];\n\n// this will not affect the value of `done`\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\n### Classes\n\nClass instances are not proxied. Instead, you can use `$state` in class fields (whether public or private), or as the first assignment to a property immediately inside the `constructor`:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\treset() {\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] The compiler transforms `done` and `text` into `get`/`set` methods on the class prototype referencing private fields. This means the properties are not enumerable.\n\nWhen calling methods in JavaScript, the value of [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) matters. This won't work, because `this` inside the `reset` method will be the `<button>` rather than the `Todo`:\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick={todo.reset}>\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\nYou can either use an inline function...\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick=+++{() => todo.reset()}>+++\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\n...or use an arrow function in the class definition:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\t+++reset = () => {+++\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Built-in classes\n\nSvelte provides reactive implementations of built-in classes like `Set`, `Map`, `Date` and `URL` that can be imported from [`svelte/reactivity`](svelte-reactivity).\n\n## `$state.raw`\n\nIn cases where you don't want objects and arrays to be deeply reactive you can use `$state.raw`.\n\nState declared with `$state.raw` cannot be mutated; it can only be _reassigned_. In other words, rather than assigning to a property of an object, or using an array method like `push`, replace the object or array altogether if you'd like to update it:\n\n```js\nlet person = $state.raw({\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 49\n});\n\n// this will have no effect\nperson.age += 1;\n\n// this will work, because we're creating a new person\nperson = {\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 50\n};\n```\n\nThis can improve performance with large arrays and objects that you weren't planning to mutate anyway, since it avoids the cost of making them reactive. Note that raw state can _contain_ reactive state (for example, a raw array of reactive objects).\n\nAs with `$state`, you can declare class fields using `$state.raw`.\n\n## `$state.snapshot`\n\nTo take a static snapshot of a deeply reactive `$state` proxy, use `$state.snapshot`:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet counter = $state({ count: 0 });\n\n\tfunction onclick() {\n\t\t// Will log `{ count: ... }` rather than `Proxy { ... }`\n\t\tconsole.log($state.snapshot(counter));\n\t}\n</script>\n```\n\nThis is handy when you want to pass some state to an external library or API that doesn't expect a proxy, such as `structuredClone`.\n\n## `$state.eager`\n\nWhen state changes, it may not be reflected in the UI immediately if it is used by an `await` expression, because [updates are synchronized](await-expressions#Synchronized-updates).\n\nIn some cases, you may want to update the UI as soon as the state changes. For example, you might want to update a navigation bar when the user clicks on a link, so that they get visual feedback while waiting for the new page to load. To do this, use `$state.eager(value)`:\n\n```svelte\n<nav>\n\t<a href=\"/\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/' ? 'page' : null}>home</a>\n\t<a href=\"/about\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/about' ? 'page' : null}>about</a>\n</nav>\n```\n\nUse this feature sparingly, and only to provide feedback in response to user action — in general, allowing Svelte to coordinate updates will provide a better user experience.\n\n## Passing state into functions\n\nJavaScript is a _pass-by-value_ language — when you call a function, the arguments are the _values_ rather than the _variables_. In other words:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {number} a\n * @param {number} b\n */\nfunction add(a, b) {\n\treturn a + b;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add(a, b);\nconsole.log(total); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(total); // still 3!\n```\n\nIf `add` wanted to have access to the _current_ values of `a` and `b`, and to return the current `total` value, you would need to use functions instead:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {() => number} getA\n * @param {() => number} getB\n */\nfunction add(+++getA, getB+++) {\n\treturn +++() => getA() + getB()+++;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add+++(() => a, () => b)+++;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 7\n```\n\nState in Svelte is no different — when you reference something declared with the `$state` rune...\n\n```js\nlet a = +++$state(1)+++;\nlet b = +++$state(2)+++;\n```\n\n...you're accessing its _current value_.\n\nNote that 'functions' is broad — it encompasses properties of proxies and [`get`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get)/[`set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) properties...\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {{ a: number, b: number }} input\n */\nfunction add(input) {\n\treturn {\n\t\tget value() {\n\t\t\treturn input.a + input.b;\n\t\t}\n\t};\n}\n\nlet input = $state({ a: 1, b: 2 });\nlet total = add(input);\nconsole.log(total.value); // 3\n\ninput.a = 3;\ninput.b = 4;\nconsole.log(total.value); // 7\n```\n\n...though if you find yourself writing code like that, consider using [classes](#Classes) instead.\n\n## Passing state across modules\n\nYou can declare state in `.svelte.js` and `.svelte.ts` files, but you can only _export_ that state if it's not directly reassigned. In other words you can't do this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = $state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\nThat's because every reference to `count` is transformed by the Svelte compiler — the code above is roughly equivalent to this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js (compiler output)\n// @filename: index.ts\ninterface Signal<T> {\n\tvalue: T;\n}\n\ninterface Svelte {\n\tstate<T>(value?: T): Signal<T>;\n\tget<T>(source: Signal<T>): T;\n\tset<T>(source: Signal<T>, value: T): void;\n}\ndeclare const $: Svelte;\n// ---cut---\nexport let count = $.state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\t$.set(count, $.get(count) + 1);\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] You can see the code Svelte generates by clicking the 'JS Output' tab in the [playground](/playground).\n\nSince the compiler only operates on one file at a time, if another file imports `count` Svelte doesn't know that it needs to wrap each reference in `$.get` and `$.set`:\n\n```js\n// @filename: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = 0;\n\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\nimport { count } from './state.svelte.js';\n\nconsole.log(typeof count); // 'object', not 'number'\n```\n\nThis leaves you with two options for sharing state between modules — either don't reassign it...\n\n```js\n// This is allowed — since we're updating\n// `counter.count` rather than `counter`,\n// Svelte doesn't wrap it in `$.state`\nexport const counter = $state({\n\tcount: 0\n});\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcounter.count += 1;\n}\n```\n\n...or don't directly export it:\n\n```js\nlet count = $state(0);\n\nexport function getCount() {\n\treturn count;\n}\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```"

Use `$derived.by` to calculate:\n   - The number of words in the text\n   - The number of characters in the text\n   - Whether the text is considered \"long\" (more than 15 words)\n4. Display all these derived values below the input field\n5. Include a \"Clear\" button that resets the text to an empty string\n\nElements should have these data-testid attributes:\n\n- \"text-input\" for the input field\n- \"word-count\" for displaying the word count\n- \"char-count\" for displaying the character count\n- \"length-indicator\" for displaying whether the text is long\n- \"clear-button\" for the clear button\n\nExample structure:\n\n```html\n<div>\n  <input data-testid=\"text-input\" type=\"text\" />\n  <button data-testid=\"clear-button\">Clear</button>\n  <div>\n    <p data-testid=\"word-count\">Words: 0</p>\n    <p data-testid=\"char-count\">Characters: 0</p>\n    <p data-testid=\"length-indicator\">Status: Short text</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nPlease implement this component using Svelte 5 runes.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: When you have finished implementing the component, use the ResultWrite tool to output your final Svelte component code.

Svelte will disallow state changes (e.g. `count++`) inside derived expressions.\n\nAs with `$state`, you can mark class fields as `$derived`.\n\n> [!NOTE] Code in Svelte components is only executed once at creation. Without the `$derived` rune, `doubled` would maintain its original value even when `count` changes.\n\n## `$derived.by`\n\nSometimes you need to create complex derivations that don't fit inside a short expression. In these cases, you can use `$derived.by` which accepts a function as its argument.\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet numbers = $state([1, 2, 3]);\n\tlet total = $derived.by(() => {\n\t\tlet total = 0;\n\t\tfor (const n of numbers) {\n\t\t\ttotal += n;\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn total;\n\t});\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => numbers.push(numbers.length + 1)}>\n\t{numbers.join(' + ')} = {total}\n</button>\n```\n\nIn essence, `$derived(expression)` is equivalent to `$derived.by(() => expression)`.\n\n## Understanding dependencies\n\nAnything read synchronously inside the `$derived` expression (or `$derived.by` function body) is considered a _dependency_ of the derived state. When the state changes, the derived will be marked as _dirty_ and recalculated when it is next read.\n\nTo exempt a piece of state from being treated as a dependency, use [`untrack`](svelte#untrack).\n\n## Overriding derived values\n\nDerived expressions are recalculated when their dependencies change, but you can temporarily override their values by reassigning them (unless they are declared with `const`). This can be useful for things like _optimistic UI_, where a value is derived from the 'source of truth' (such as data from your server) but you'd like to show immediate feedback to the user:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet { post, like } = $props();\n\n\tlet likes = $derived(post.likes);\n\n\tasync function onclick() {\n\t\t// increment the `likes` count immediately...\n\t\tlikes += 1;\n\n\t\t// and tell the server, which will eventually update `post`\n\t\ttry {\n\t\t\tawait like();\n\t\t} catch {\n\t\t\t// failed! roll back the change\n\t\t\tlikes -= 1;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n</script>\n\n<button {onclick}>🧡 {likes}</button>\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] Prior to Svelte 5.25, deriveds were read-only.\n\n## Deriveds and reactivity\n\nUnlike `$state`, which converts objects and arrays to [deeply reactive proxies]($state#Deep-state), `$derived` values are left as-is. For example, [in a case like this](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE4VU22rjMBD9lUHd3aaQi9PdstS1A3t5XvpQ2Ic4D7I1iUUV2UjjNMX431eS7TRdSosxgjMzZ45mjt0yzffIYibvy0ojFJWqDKCQVBk2ZVup0LJ43TJ6rn2aBxw-FP2o67k9oCKP5dziW3hRaUJNjoYltjCyplWmM1JIIAn3FlL4ZIkTTtYez6jtj4w8WwyXv9GiIXiQxLVs9pfTMR7EuoSLIuLFbX7Z4930bZo_nBrD1bs834tlfvsBz9_SyX6PZXu9XaL4gOWn4sXjeyzftv4ZWfyxubpzxzg6LfD4MrooxELEosKCUPigQCMPKCZh0OtQE1iSxcsmdHuBvCiHZXALLXiN08EL3RRkaJ_kDVGle0HcSD5TPEeVtj67O4Nrg9aiSNtBY5oODJkrL5QsHtN2cgXp6nSJMWzpWWGasdlsGEMbzi5jPr5KFr0Ep7pdeM2-TCelCddIhDxAobi1jqF3cMaC1RKp64bAW9iFAmXGIHfd4wNXDabtOLN53w8W53VvJoZLh7xk4Rr3CoL-UNoLhWHrT1JQGcM17u96oES5K-kc2XOzkzqGCKL5De79OUTyyrg1zgwXsrEx3ESfx4Bz0M5UjVMHB24mw9SuXtXFoN13fYKOM1tyUT3FbvbWmSWCZX2Er-41u5xPoml45svRahl9Wb9aasbINJixDZwcPTbyTLZSUsAvrg_cPuCR7s782_WU8343Y72Qtlb8OYatwuOQvuN13M_hJKNfxann1v1U_B1KZ_D_mzhzhz24fw85CSz2irtN9w9HshBK7AQAAA==)...\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7005\nlet items = $state([ /*...*/ ]);\n\nlet index = $state(0);\nlet selected = $derived(items[index]);\n```\n\n...you can change (or `bind:` to) properties of `selected` and it will affect the underlying `items` array. If `items` was _not_ deeply reactive, mutating `selected` would have no effect.\n\n## Destructuring\n\nIf you use destructuring with a `$derived` declaration, the resulting variables will all be reactive — this...\n\n```js\nfunction stuff() { return { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 } }\n// ---cut---\nlet { a, b, c } = $derived(stuff());\n```\n\n...is roughly equivalent to this:\n\n```js\nfunction stuff() { return { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 } }\n// ---cut---\nlet _stuff = $derived(stuff());\nlet a = $derived(_stuff.a);\nlet b = $derived(_stuff.b);\nlet c = $derived(_stuff.c);\n```\n\n## Update propagation\n\nSvelte uses something called _push-pull reactivity_ — when state is updated, everything that depends on the state (whether directly or indirectly) is immediately notified of the change (the 'push'), but derived values are not re-evaluated until they are actually read (the 'pull').\n\nIf the new value of a derived is referentially identical to its previous value, downstream updates will be skipped. In other words, Svelte will only update the text inside the button when `large` changes, not when `count` changes, even though `large` depends on `count`:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet count = $state(0);\n\tlet large = $derived(count > 10);\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => count++}>\n\t{large}\n</button>\n```\n\n---\n\n## $state\n\nThe `$state` rune allows you to create _reactive state_, which means that your UI _reacts_ when it changes.\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet count = $state(0);\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => count++}>\n\tclicks: {count}\n</button>\n```\n\nUnlike other frameworks you may have encountered, there is no API for interacting with state — `count` is just a number, rather than an object or a function, and you can update it like you would update any other variable.\n\n### Deep state\n\nIf `$state` is used with an array or a simple object, the result is a deeply reactive _state proxy_. [Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) allow Svelte to run code when you read or write properties, including via methods like `array.push(...)`, triggering granular updates.\n\nState is proxified recursively until Svelte finds something other than an array or simple object (like a class or an object created with `Object.create`). In a case like this...\n\n```js\nlet todos = $state([\n\t{\n\t\tdone: false,\n\t\ttext: 'add more todos'\n\t}\n]);\n```\n\n...modifying an individual todo's property will trigger updates to anything in your UI that depends on that specific property:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\nIf you push a new object to the array, it will also be proxified:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos.push({\n\tdone: false,\n\ttext: 'eat lunch'\n});\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] When you update properties of proxies, the original object is _not_ mutated. If you need to use your own proxy handlers in a state proxy, [you should wrap the object _after_ wrapping it in `$state`](https://svelte.dev/playground/hello-world?version=latest#H4sIAAAAAAAACpWR3WoDIRCFX2UqhWyIJL3erAulL9C7XnQLMe5ksbUqOpsfln33YuyGFNJC8UKdc2bOhw7Myk9kJXsJ0nttO9jcR5KEG9AWJDwHdzwxznbaYGTl68Do5JM_FRifuh-9X8Y9Gkq1rYx4q66cJbQUWcmqqIL2VDe2IYMEbvuOikBADi-GJDSkXG-phId0G-frye2DO2psQYDFQ0Ys8gQO350dUkEydEg82T0GOs0nsSG9g2IqgxACZueo2ZUlpdvoDC6N64qsg1QKY8T2bpZp8gpIfbCQ85Zn50Ud82HkeY83uDjspenxv3jXcSDyjPWf9L1vJf0GH666J-jLu1ery4dV257IWXBWGa0-xFDMQdTTn2ScxWKsn86ROsLwQxqrVR5QM84Ij8TKFD2-cUZSm4O2LSt30kQcvwCgCmfZnAIAAA==).\n\nNote that if you destructure a reactive value, the references are not reactive — as in normal JavaScript, they are evaluated at the point of destructuring:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\nlet { done, text } = todos[0];\n\n// this will not affect the value of `done`\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\n### Classes\n\nClass instances are not proxied. Instead, you can use `$state` in class fields (whether public or private), or as the first assignment to a property immediately inside the `constructor`:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\treset() {\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] The compiler transforms `done` and `text` into `get`/`set` methods on the class prototype referencing private fields. This means the properties are not enumerable.\n\nWhen calling methods in JavaScript, the value of [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) matters. This won't work, because `this` inside the `reset` method will be the `<button>` rather than the `Todo`:\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick={todo.reset}>\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\nYou can either use an inline function...\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick=+++{() => todo.reset()}>+++\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\n...or use an arrow function in the class definition:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\t+++reset = () => {+++\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Built-in classes\n\nSvelte provides reactive implementations of built-in classes like `Set`, `Map`, `Date` and `URL` that can be imported from [`svelte/reactivity`](svelte-reactivity).\n\n## `$state.raw`\n\nIn cases where you don't want objects and arrays to be deeply reactive you can use `$state.raw`.\n\nState declared with `$state.raw` cannot be mutated; it can only be _reassigned_. In other words, rather than assigning to a property of an object, or using an array method like `push`, replace the object or array altogether if you'd like to update it:\n\n```js\nlet person = $state.raw({\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 49\n});\n\n// this will have no effect\nperson.age += 1;\n\n// this will work, because we're creating a new person\nperson = {\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 50\n};\n```\n\nThis can improve performance with large arrays and objects that you weren't planning to mutate anyway, since it avoids the cost of making them reactive. Note that raw state can _contain_ reactive state (for example, a raw array of reactive objects).\n\nAs with `$state`, you can declare class fields using `$state.raw`.\n\n## `$state.snapshot`\n\nTo take a static snapshot of a deeply reactive `$state` proxy, use `$state.snapshot`:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet counter = $state({ count: 0 });\n\n\tfunction onclick() {\n\t\t// Will log `{ count: ... }` rather than `Proxy { ... }`\n\t\tconsole.log($state.snapshot(counter));\n\t}\n</script>\n```\n\nThis is handy when you want to pass some state to an external library or API that doesn't expect a proxy, such as `structuredClone`.\n\n## `$state.eager`\n\nWhen state changes, it may not be reflected in the UI immediately if it is used by an `await` expression, because [updates are synchronized](await-expressions#Synchronized-updates).\n\nIn some cases, you may want to update the UI as soon as the state changes. For example, you might want to update a navigation bar when the user clicks on a link, so that they get visual feedback while waiting for the new page to load. To do this, use `$state.eager(value)`:\n\n```svelte\n<nav>\n\t<a href=\"/\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/' ? 'page' : null}>home</a>\n\t<a href=\"/about\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/about' ? 'page' : null}>about</a>\n</nav>\n```\n\nUse this feature sparingly, and only to provide feedback in response to user action — in general, allowing Svelte to coordinate updates will provide a better user experience.\n\n## Passing state into functions\n\nJavaScript is a _pass-by-value_ language — when you call a function, the arguments are the _values_ rather than the _variables_. In other words:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {number} a\n * @param {number} b\n */\nfunction add(a, b) {\n\treturn a + b;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add(a, b);\nconsole.log(total); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(total); // still 3!\n```\n\nIf `add` wanted to have access to the _current_ values of `a` and `b`, and to return the current `total` value, you would need to use functions instead:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {() => number} getA\n * @param {() => number} getB\n */\nfunction add(+++getA, getB+++) {\n\treturn +++() => getA() + getB()+++;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add+++(() => a, () => b)+++;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 7\n```\n\nState in Svelte is no different — when you reference something declared with the `$state` rune...\n\n```js\nlet a = +++$state(1)+++;\nlet b = +++$state(2)+++;\n```\n\n...you're accessing its _current value_.\n\nNote that 'functions' is broad — it encompasses properties of proxies and [`get`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get)/[`set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) properties...\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {{ a: number, b: number }} input\n */\nfunction add(input) {\n\treturn {\n\t\tget value() {\n\t\t\treturn input.a + input.b;\n\t\t}\n\t};\n}\n\nlet input = $state({ a: 1, b: 2 });\nlet total = add(input);\nconsole.log(total.value); // 3\n\ninput.a = 3;\ninput.b = 4;\nconsole.log(total.value); // 7\n```\n\n...though if you find yourself writing code like that, consider using [classes](#Classes) instead.\n\n## Passing state across modules\n\nYou can declare state in `.svelte.js` and `.svelte.ts` files, but you can only _export_ that state if it's not directly reassigned. In other words you can't do this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = $state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\nThat's because every reference to `count` is transformed by the Svelte compiler — the code above is roughly equivalent to this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js (compiler output)\n// @filename: index.ts\ninterface Signal<T> {\n\tvalue: T;\n}\n\ninterface Svelte {\n\tstate<T>(value?: T): Signal<T>;\n\tget<T>(source: Signal<T>): T;\n\tset<T>(source: Signal<T>, value: T): void;\n}\ndeclare const $: Svelte;\n// ---cut---\nexport let count = $.state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\t$.set(count, $.get(count) + 1);\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] You can see the code Svelte generates by clicking the 'JS Output' tab in the [playground](/playground).\n\nSince the compiler only operates on one file at a time, if another file imports `count` Svelte doesn't know that it needs to wrap each reference in `$.get` and `$.set`:\n\n```js\n// @filename: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = 0;\n\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\nimport { count } from './state.svelte.js';\n\nconsole.log(typeof count); // 'object', not 'number'\n```\n\nThis leaves you with two options for sharing state between modules — either don't reassign it...\n\n```js\n// This is allowed — since we're updating\n// `counter.count` rather than `counter`,\n// Svelte doesn't wrap it in `$.state`\nexport const counter = $state({\n\tcount: 0\n});\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcounter.count += 1;\n}\n```\n\n...or don't directly export it:\n\n```js\nlet count = $state(0);\n\nexport function getCount() {\n\treturn count;\n}\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```"

Svelte will disallow state changes (e.g. `count++`) inside derived expressions.\n\nAs with `$state`, you can mark class fields as `$derived`.\n\n> [!NOTE] Code in Svelte components is only executed once at creation. Without the `$derived` rune, `doubled` would maintain its original value even when `count` changes.\n\n## `$derived.by`\n\nSometimes you need to create complex derivations that don't fit inside a short expression. In these cases, you can use `$derived.by` which accepts a function as its argument.\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet numbers = $state([1, 2, 3]);\n\tlet total = $derived.by(() => {\n\t\tlet total = 0;\n\t\tfor (const n of numbers) {\n\t\t\ttotal += n;\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn total;\n\t});\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => numbers.push(numbers.length + 1)}>\n\t{numbers.join(' + ')} = {total}\n</button>\n```\n\nIn essence, `$derived(expression)` is equivalent to `$derived.by(() => expression)`.\n\n## Understanding dependencies\n\nAnything read synchronously inside the `$derived` expression (or `$derived.by` function body) is considered a _dependency_ of the derived state. When the state changes, the derived will be marked as _dirty_ and recalculated when it is next read.\n\nTo exempt a piece of state from being treated as a dependency, use [`untrack`](svelte#untrack).\n\n## Overriding derived values\n\nDerived expressions are recalculated when their dependencies change, but you can temporarily override their values by reassigning them (unless they are declared with `const`). This can be useful for things like _optimistic UI_, where a value is derived from the 'source of truth' (such as data from your server) but you'd like to show immediate feedback to the user:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet { post, like } = $props();\n\n\tlet likes = $derived(post.likes);\n\n\tasync function onclick() {\n\t\t// increment the `likes` count immediately...\n\t\tlikes += 1;\n\n\t\t// and tell the server, which will eventually update `post`\n\t\ttry {\n\t\t\tawait like();\n\t\t} catch {\n\t\t\t// failed! roll back the change\n\t\t\tlikes -= 1;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n</script>\n\n<button {onclick}>🧡 {likes}</button>\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] Prior to Svelte 5.25, deriveds were read-only.\n\n## Deriveds and reactivity\n\nUnlike `$state`, which converts objects and arrays to [deeply reactive proxies]($state#Deep-state), `$derived` values are left as-is. For example, [in a case like this](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE4VU22rjMBD9lUHd3aaQi9PdstS1A3t5XvpQ2Ic4D7I1iUUV2UjjNMX431eS7TRdSosxgjMzZ45mjt0yzffIYibvy0ojFJWqDKCQVBk2ZVup0LJ43TJ6rn2aBxw-FP2o67k9oCKP5dziW3hRaUJNjoYltjCyplWmM1JIIAn3FlL4ZIkTTtYez6jtj4w8WwyXv9GiIXiQxLVs9pfTMR7EuoSLIuLFbX7Z4930bZo_nBrD1bs834tlfvsBz9_SyX6PZXu9XaL4gOWn4sXjeyzftv4ZWfyxubpzxzg6LfD4MrooxELEosKCUPigQCMPKCZh0OtQE1iSxcsmdHuBvCiHZXALLXiN08EL3RRkaJ_kDVGle0HcSD5TPEeVtj67O4Nrg9aiSNtBY5oODJkrL5QsHtN2cgXp6nSJMWzpWWGasdlsGEMbzi5jPr5KFr0Ep7pdeM2-TCelCddIhDxAobi1jqF3cMaC1RKp64bAW9iFAmXGIHfd4wNXDabtOLN53w8W53VvJoZLh7xk4Rr3CoL-UNoLhWHrT1JQGcM17u96oES5K-kc2XOzkzqGCKL5De79OUTyyrg1zgwXsrEx3ESfx4Bz0M5UjVMHB24mw9SuXtXFoN13fYKOM1tyUT3FbvbWmSWCZX2Er-41u5xPoml45svRahl9Wb9aasbINJixDZwcPTbyTLZSUsAvrg_cPuCR7s782_WU8343Y72Qtlb8OYatwuOQvuN13M_hJKNfxann1v1U_B1KZ_D_mzhzhz24fw85CSz2irtN9w9HshBK7AQAAA==)...\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7005\nlet items = $state([ /*...*/ ]);\n\nlet index = $state(0);\nlet selected = $derived(items[index]);\n```\n\n...you can change (or `bind:` to) properties of `selected` and it will affect the underlying `items` array. If `items` was _not_ deeply reactive, mutating `selected` would have no effect.\n\n## Destructuring\n\nIf you use destructuring with a `$derived` declaration, the resulting variables will all be reactive — this...\n\n```js\nfunction stuff() { return { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 } }\n// ---cut---\nlet { a, b, c } = $derived(stuff());\n```\n\n...is roughly equivalent to this:\n\n```js\nfunction stuff() { return { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 } }\n// ---cut---\nlet _stuff = $derived(stuff());\nlet a = $derived(_stuff.a);\nlet b = $derived(_stuff.b);\nlet c = $derived(_stuff.c);\n```\n\n## Update propagation\n\nSvelte uses something called _push-pull reactivity_ — when state is updated, everything that depends on the state (whether directly or indirectly) is immediately notified of the change (the 'push'), but derived values are not re-evaluated until they are actually read (the 'pull').\n\nIf the new value of a derived is referentially identical to its previous value, downstream updates will be skipped. In other words, Svelte will only update the text inside the button when `large` changes, not when `count` changes, even though `large` depends on `count`:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet count = $state(0);\n\tlet large = $derived(count > 10);\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => count++}>\n\t{large}\n</button>\n```\n\n---\n\n## $state\n\nThe `$state` rune allows you to create _reactive state_, which means that your UI _reacts_ when it changes.\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet count = $state(0);\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => count++}>\n\tclicks: {count}\n</button>\n```\n\nUnlike other frameworks you may have encountered, there is no API for interacting with state — `count` is just a number, rather than an object or a function, and you can update it like you would update any other variable.\n\n### Deep state\n\nIf `$state` is used with an array or a simple object, the result is a deeply reactive _state proxy_. [Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) allow Svelte to run code when you read or write properties, including via methods like `array.push(...)`, triggering granular updates.\n\nState is proxified recursively until Svelte finds something other than an array or simple object (like a class or an object created with `Object.create`). In a case like this...\n\n```js\nlet todos = $state([\n\t{\n\t\tdone: false,\n\t\ttext: 'add more todos'\n\t}\n]);\n```\n\n...modifying an individual todo's property will trigger updates to anything in your UI that depends on that specific property:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\nIf you push a new object to the array, it will also be proxified:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos.push({\n\tdone: false,\n\ttext: 'eat lunch'\n});\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] When you update properties of proxies, the original object is _not_ mutated. If you need to use your own proxy handlers in a state proxy, [you should wrap the object _after_ wrapping it in `$state`](https://svelte.dev/playground/hello-world?version=latest#H4sIAAAAAAAACpWR3WoDIRCFX2UqhWyIJL3erAulL9C7XnQLMe5ksbUqOpsfln33YuyGFNJC8UKdc2bOhw7Myk9kJXsJ0nttO9jcR5KEG9AWJDwHdzwxznbaYGTl68Do5JM_FRifuh-9X8Y9Gkq1rYx4q66cJbQUWcmqqIL2VDe2IYMEbvuOikBADi-GJDSkXG-phId0G-frye2DO2psQYDFQ0Ys8gQO350dUkEydEg82T0GOs0nsSG9g2IqgxACZueo2ZUlpdvoDC6N64qsg1QKY8T2bpZp8gpIfbCQ85Zn50Ud82HkeY83uDjspenxv3jXcSDyjPWf9L1vJf0GH666J-jLu1ery4dV257IWXBWGa0-xFDMQdTTn2ScxWKsn86ROsLwQxqrVR5QM84Ij8TKFD2-cUZSm4O2LSt30kQcvwCgCmfZnAIAAA==).\n\nNote that if you destructure a reactive value, the references are not reactive — as in normal JavaScript, they are evaluated at the point of destructuring:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\nlet { done, text } = todos[0];\n\n// this will not affect the value of `done`\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\n### Classes\n\nClass instances are not proxied. Instead, you can use `$state` in class fields (whether public or private), or as the first assignment to a property immediately inside the `constructor`:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\treset() {\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] The compiler transforms `done` and `text` into `get`/`set` methods on the class prototype referencing private fields. This means the properties are not enumerable.\n\nWhen calling methods in JavaScript, the value of [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) matters. This won't work, because `this` inside the `reset` method will be the `<button>` rather than the `Todo`:\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick={todo.reset}>\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\nYou can either use an inline function...\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick=+++{() => todo.reset()}>+++\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\n...or use an arrow function in the class definition:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\t+++reset = () => {+++\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Built-in classes\n\nSvelte provides reactive implementations of built-in classes like `Set`, `Map`, `Date` and `URL` that can be imported from [`svelte/reactivity`](svelte-reactivity).\n\n## `$state.raw`\n\nIn cases where you don't want objects and arrays to be deeply reactive you can use `$state.raw`.\n\nState declared with `$state.raw` cannot be mutated; it can only be _reassigned_. In other words, rather than assigning to a property of an object, or using an array method like `push`, replace the object or array altogether if you'd like to update it:\n\n```js\nlet person = $state.raw({\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 49\n});\n\n// this will have no effect\nperson.age += 1;\n\n// this will work, because we're creating a new person\nperson = {\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 50\n};\n```\n\nThis can improve performance with large arrays and objects that you weren't planning to mutate anyway, since it avoids the cost of making them reactive. Note that raw state can _contain_ reactive state (for example, a raw array of reactive objects).\n\nAs with `$state`, you can declare class fields using `$state.raw`.\n\n## `$state.snapshot`\n\nTo take a static snapshot of a deeply reactive `$state` proxy, use `$state.snapshot`:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet counter = $state({ count: 0 });\n\n\tfunction onclick() {\n\t\t// Will log `{ count: ... }` rather than `Proxy { ... }`\n\t\tconsole.log($state.snapshot(counter));\n\t}\n</script>\n```\n\nThis is handy when you want to pass some state to an external library or API that doesn't expect a proxy, such as `structuredClone`.\n\n## `$state.eager`\n\nWhen state changes, it may not be reflected in the UI immediately if it is used by an `await` expression, because [updates are synchronized](await-expressions#Synchronized-updates).\n\nIn some cases, you may want to update the UI as soon as the state changes. For example, you might want to update a navigation bar when the user clicks on a link, so that they get visual feedback while waiting for the new page to load. To do this, use `$state.eager(value)`:\n\n```svelte\n<nav>\n\t<a href=\"/\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/' ? 'page' : null}>home</a>\n\t<a href=\"/about\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/about' ? 'page' : null}>about</a>\n</nav>\n```\n\nUse this feature sparingly, and only to provide feedback in response to user action — in general, allowing Svelte to coordinate updates will provide a better user experience.\n\n## Passing state into functions\n\nJavaScript is a _pass-by-value_ language — when you call a function, the arguments are the _values_ rather than the _variables_. In other words:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {number} a\n * @param {number} b\n */\nfunction add(a, b) {\n\treturn a + b;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add(a, b);\nconsole.log(total); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(total); // still 3!\n```\n\nIf `add` wanted to have access to the _current_ values of `a` and `b`, and to return the current `total` value, you would need to use functions instead:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {() => number} getA\n * @param {() => number} getB\n */\nfunction add(+++getA, getB+++) {\n\treturn +++() => getA() + getB()+++;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add+++(() => a, () => b)+++;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 7\n```\n\nState in Svelte is no different — when you reference something declared with the `$state` rune...\n\n```js\nlet a = +++$state(1)+++;\nlet b = +++$state(2)+++;\n```\n\n...you're accessing its _current value_.\n\nNote that 'functions' is broad — it encompasses properties of proxies and [`get`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get)/[`set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) properties...\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {{ a: number, b: number }} input\n */\nfunction add(input) {\n\treturn {\n\t\tget value() {\n\t\t\treturn input.a + input.b;\n\t\t}\n\t};\n}\n\nlet input = $state({ a: 1, b: 2 });\nlet total = add(input);\nconsole.log(total.value); // 3\n\ninput.a = 3;\ninput.b = 4;\nconsole.log(total.value); // 7\n```\n\n...though if you find yourself writing code like that, consider using [classes](#Classes) instead.\n\n## Passing state across modules\n\nYou can declare state in `.svelte.js` and `.svelte.ts` files, but you can only _export_ that state if it's not directly reassigned. In other words you can't do this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = $state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\nThat's because every reference to `count` is transformed by the Svelte compiler — the code above is roughly equivalent to this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js (compiler output)\n// @filename: index.ts\ninterface Signal<T> {\n\tvalue: T;\n}\n\ninterface Svelte {\n\tstate<T>(value?: T): Signal<T>;\n\tget<T>(source: Signal<T>): T;\n\tset<T>(source: Signal<T>, value: T): void;\n}\ndeclare const $: Svelte;\n// ---cut---\nexport let count = $.state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\t$.set(count, $.get(count) + 1);\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] You can see the code Svelte generates by clicking the 'JS Output' tab in the [playground](/playground).\n\nSince the compiler only operates on one file at a time, if another file imports `count` Svelte doesn't know that it needs to wrap each reference in `$.get` and `$.set`:\n\n```js\n// @filename: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = 0;\n\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\nimport { count } from './state.svelte.js';\n\nconsole.log(typeof count); // 'object', not 'number'\n```\n\nThis leaves you with two options for sharing state between modules — either don't reassign it...\n\n```js\n// This is allowed — since we're updating\n// `counter.count` rather than `counter`,\n// Svelte doesn't wrap it in `$.state`\nexport const counter = $state({\n\tcount: 0\n});\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcounter.count += 1;\n}\n```\n\n...or don't directly export it:\n\n```js\nlet count = $state(0);\n\nexport function getCount() {\n\treturn count;\n}\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```"

Create a component with a hardcoded array of 3 book titles (strings) - \"The Lord of the Rings\", \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", and \"1984\"\n2. Create a snippet called `title` that takes a book title string as a parameter\n3. The snippet should display the book title in a `<span>` element with `data-testid=\"book-title\"`\n4. Use the `{@render ...}` syntax to render the snippet for each book title in a list\n5. Each rendered title should be wrapped in a `<li>` element with `data-testid=\"book-item\"`\n\n## Example HTML structure:\n\n```html\n<ul>\n  <li data-testid=\"book-item\">The Lord of the Rings</li>\n  <li data-testid=\"book-item\">To Kill a Mockingbird</li>\n  <li data-testid=\"book-item\">1984</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nPlease implement this component using Svelte 5 runes.\n",

Create a component with a hardcoded array of 3 book titles (strings) - \"The Lord of the Rings\", \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", and \"1984\"\n2. Create a snippet called `title` that takes a book title string as a parameter\n3. The snippet should display the book title in a `<span>` element with `data-testid=\"book-title\"`\n4. Use the `{@render ...}` syntax to render the snippet for each book title in a list\n5. Each rendered title should be wrapped in a `<li>` element with `data-testid=\"book-item\"`\n\n## Example HTML structure:\n\n```html\n<ul>\n  <li data-testid=\"book-item\">The Lord of the Rings</li>\n  <li data-testid=\"book-item\">To Kill a Mockingbird</li>\n  <li data-testid=\"book-item\">1984</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nPlease implement this component using Svelte 5 runes.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: When you have finished implementing the component, use the ResultWrite tool to output your final Svelte component code. Only output the component code itself, no explanations or markdown formatting."

Create a snippet called `title` that takes a book title string as a parameter\n3. The snippet should display the book title in a `<span>` element with `data-testid=\"book-title\"`\n4. Use the `{@render ...}` syntax to render the snippet for each book title in a list\n5.

You cannot use rest parameters, however.\n\n## Snippet scope\n\nSnippets can be declared anywhere inside your component. They can reference values declared outside themselves, for example in the `<script>` tag or in `{#each ...}` blocks ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE12P0QrCMAxFfyWrwhSEvc8p-h1OcG5RC10bmkyQ0n-3HQPBx3vCPUmCemiDrOpLULYbUdXqTKR2Sj6UA7_RCKbMbvJ9Jg33XpMcW9uKQYEAIzJ3T4QD3LSUDE-PnYA4YET4uOkGMc3W5B3xZrtvbVP9HDas2GqiZHqhMW6Tr9jGbG_oOCMImcUCwrIpFk1FqRyqpRpn0cmjHdAvnrIzuscyq_4nd3dPPD01ukE_NA6qFj9hvMYvGjJADw8BAAA=))...\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet { message = `it's great to see you!` } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{#snippet hello(name)}\n\t<p>hello {name}! {message}!</p>\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render hello('alice')}\n{@render hello('bob')}\n```\n\n...and they are 'visible' to everything in the same lexical scope (i.e. siblings, and children of those siblings):\n\n```svelte\n<div>\n\t{#snippet x()}\n\t\t{#snippet y()}...{/snippet}\n\n\t\t<!-- this is fine -->\n\t\t{@render y()}\n\t{/snippet}\n\n\t<!-- this will error, as `y` is not in scope -->\n\t{@render y()}\n</div>\n\n<!-- this will also error, as `x` is not in scope -->\n{@render x()}\n```\n\nSnippets can reference themselves and each other ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE2WPTQqDMBCFrxLiRqH1Zysi7TlqF1YnENBJSGJLCYGeo5tesUeosfYH3c2bee_jjaWMd6BpfrAU6x5oTvdS0g01V-mFPkNnYNRaDKrxGxto5FKCIaeu1kYwFkauwsoUWtZYPh_3W5FMY4U2mb3egL9kIwY0rbhgiO-sDTgjSEqSTvIDs-jiOP7i_MHuFGAL6p9BtiSbOTl0GtzCuihqE87cqtyam6WRGz_vRcsZh5bmRg3gju4Fptq_kzQBAAA=)):\n\n```svelte\n{#snippet blastoff()}\n\t<span>🚀</span>\n{/snippet}\n\n{#snippet countdown(n)}\n\t{#if n > 0}\n\t\t<span>{n}...</span>\n\t\t{@render countdown(n - 1)}\n\t{:else}\n\t\t{@render blastoff()}\n\t{/if}\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render countdown(10)}\n```\n\n## Passing snippets to components\n\n### Explicit props\n\nWithin the template, snippets are values just like any other. As such, they can be passed to components as props ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3VS247aMBD9lZGpBGwDASRegonaPvQL2qdlH5zYEKvBNvbQLbL875VzAcKyj3PmzJnLGU8UOwqSkd8KJdaCk4TsZS0cyV49wYuJuQiQpGd-N2bu_ooaI1YwJ57hpVYoFDqSEepKKw3mO7VDeTTaIvxiRS1gb_URxvO0ibrS8WanIrHUyiHs7Vmigy28RmyHHmKvDMbMmFq4cQInvGSwTsBYWYoMVhCSB2rBFFPsyl0uruTlR3JZCWvlTXl1Yy_mawiR_rbZKZrellJ-5JQ0RiBUgnFhJ9OGR7HKmwVoilXeIye8DOJGfYCgRlZ3iE876TBsZPX7hPdteO75PC4QaIo8vwNPePmANQ2fMeEFHrLD7rR1jTNkW986E8C3KwfwVr8HSHOSEBT_kGRozyIkn_zQveXDL3rIfPJHtUDwzShJd_Qk3gQCbOGLsdq4yfTRJopRuin3I7nv6kL7ARRjmLdBDG3uv1mhuLA3V2mKtqNEf_oCn8p9aN-WYqH5peP4kWBl1UwJzAEPT9U7K--0fRrrWnPTXpCm1_EVdXjpNmlA8G1hPPyM1fKgMqjFHjctXGjLhZ05w0qpDhksGrybuNEHtJnCalZWsuaTlfq6nPaaBSv_HKw-K57BjzOiVj9ZKQYKzQjZodYFqydYTRN4gPhVzTDO2xnma3HsVWjaLjT8nbfwHy7Q5f2dBAAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\timport Table from './Table.svelte';\n\n\tconst fruits = [\n\t\t{ name: 'apples', qty: 5, price: 2 },\n\t\t{ name: 'bananas', qty: 10, price: 1 },\n\t\t{ name: 'cherries', qty: 20, price: 0.5 }\n\t];\n</script>\n\n{#snippet header()}\n\t<th>fruit</th>\n\t<th>qty</th>\n\t<th>price</th>\n\t<th>total</th>\n{/snippet}\n\n{#snippet row(d)}\n\t<td>{d.name}</td>\n\t<td>{d.qty}</td>\n\t<td>{d.price}</td>\n\t<td>{d.qty * d.price}</td>\n{/snippet}\n\n<Table data={fruits} {header} {row} />\n```\n\nThink about it like passing content instead of data to a component. The concept is similar to slots in web components.\n\n### Implicit props\n\nAs an authoring convenience, snippets declared directly _inside_ a component implicitly become props _on_ the component ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3VSTa_aMBD8Kyu_SkAbCA-JSzBR20N_QXt6vIMTO8SqsY29tI2s_PcqTiB8vaPHs7MzuxuIZgdBMvJLo0QlOElIJZXwJHsLBBvb_XUASc7Mb9Yu_B-hsMMK5sUzvDQahUZPMkJ96aTFfKd3KA_WOISfrFACKmcOMFmk8TWUTjY73RFLoz1C5U4SPWzhrcN2GKDrlcGEWauEnyRwxCaDdQLWyVJksII2uaMWTDPNLtzX5YX8-kgua-GcHJVXI3u5WEPb0d83O03TMZSmfRzOkG1Db7mNacOL19JagVALxoWbztq-H8U6j0SaYp2P2BGbOyQ2v8PQIFMXLKRDk177pq0zf6d8bMrzwBdd0pamyPMb-IjNEzS2f86Gz_Dwf-2F9nvNSUJQ_EOSoTuJNvngqK5v4Pas7n4-OCwlEEJcQTIMO-nSQwtb-GSdsX46e9gbRoP9yGQ11I0rEuycunu6PHx1QnPhxm3SFN15MOlYEFJZtf0dUywMbwZOeBGsrKNLYB54-1R9WNqVdki7usim6VmQphf7mnpshiQRhNAXdoOfMyX3OgMlKtz0cGEcF27uLSul3mewjPjgOOoDukxjPS9rqfh0pb-8zs6aBSt_7505aZ7B9xOi0T9YKW4UooVsr0zB1BTrWQJ3EL-oWcZ572GxFoezCk37QLe3897-B2i2U62uBAAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<!-- this is semantically the same as the above -->\n<Table data={fruits}>\n\t{#snippet header()}\n\t\t<th>fruit</th>\n\t\t<th>qty</th>\n\t\t<th>price</th>\n\t\t<th>total</th>\n\t{/snippet}\n\n\t{#snippet row(d)}\n\t\t<td>{d.name}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.qty}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.price}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.qty * d.price}</td>\n\t{/snippet}\n</Table>\n```\n\n### Implicit `children` snippet\n\nAny content inside the component tags that is _not_ a snippet declaration implicitly becomes part of the `children` snippet ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WOQQrCMBBFrzIMggql3ddY1Du4si5sOmIwnYRkFKX07lKqglqX8_7_w2uRDw1hjlsWI5ZqTPBoLEXMdy3K3fdZDzB5Ndfep_FKVnpWHSKNce1YiCVijirqYLwUJQOYxrsgsLmIOIZjcA1M02w4n-PpomSVvTclqyEutDX6DA2pZ7_ABIVugrmEC3XJH92P55_G39GodCmWBFrQJ2PrQAwdLGHig_NxNv9xrQa1dhWIawrv1Wzeqawa8953D-8QOmaEAQAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<!--- file: App.svelte --->\n<Button>click me</Button>\n```\n\n```svelte\n<!--- file: Button.svelte --->\n<script>\n\tlet { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n<!-- result will be <button>click me</button> -->\n<button>{@render children()}</button>\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] Note that you cannot have a prop called `children` if you also have content inside the component — for this reason, you should avoid having props with that name\n\n### Optional snippet props\n\nYou can declare snippet props as being optional. You can either use optional chaining to not render anything if the snippet isn't set...\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    let { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{@render children?.()}\n```\n\n...or use an `#if` block to render fallback content:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    let { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{#if children}\n    {@render children()}\n{:else}\n    fallback content\n{/if}\n```\n\n## Typing snippets\n\nSnippets implement the `Snippet` interface imported from `'svelte'`:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\">\n\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\n\n\tinterface Props {\n\t\tdata: any[];\n\t\tchildren: Snippet;\n\t\trow: Snippet<[any]>;\n\t}\n\n\tlet { data, children, row }: Props = $props();\n</script>\n```\n\nWith this change, red squigglies will appear if you try and use the component without providing a `data` prop and a `row` snippet. Notice that the type argument provided to `Snippet` is a tuple, since snippets can have multiple parameters.\n\nWe can tighten things up further by declaring a generic, so that `data` and `row` refer to the same type:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\" generics=\"T\">\n\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\n\n\tlet {\n\t\tdata,\n\t\tchildren,\n\t\trow\n\t}: {\n\t\tdata: T[];\n\t\tchildren: Snippet;\n\t\trow: Snippet<[T]>;\n\t} = $props();\n</script>\n```\n\n## Exporting snippets\n\nSnippets declared at the top level of a `.svelte` file can be exported from a `<script module>` for use in other components, provided they don't reference any declarations in a non-module `<script>` (whether directly or indirectly, via other snippets) ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WPwY7CMAxEf8UyB1hRgdhjl13Bga8gHFJipEqtGyUGFUX5dxJUtEB3b9bYM_MckHVLWOKut50TMuC5tpbEY4GnuiGP5T6gXG0-ykLSB8vW2oW_UCNZq7Snv_Rjx0Kc4kpc-6OrrfwoVlK3uQ4CaGMgwsl1LUwXy0f54J9-KV4vf20cNo7YkMu22aqAz4-oOLUI9YKluDPF4h_at-hX5PFyzA1tZ84N3fGpf8YfUU6GvDumLqDKmEqCjjCHUEX4hqDTWCU5PJ6Or38c4g1cPu9tnAEAAA==)):\n\n```svelte\n<script module>\n\texport { add };\n</script>\n\n{#snippet add(a, b)}\n\t{a} + {b} = {a + b}\n{/snippet}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This requires Svelte 5.5.0 or newer\n\n## Programmatic snippets\n\nSnippets can be created programmatically with the [`createRawSnippet`](svelte#createRawSnippet) API. This is intended for advanced use cases.\n\n## Snippets and slots\n\nIn Svelte 4, content can be passed to components using [slots](legacy-slots). Snippets are more powerful and flexible, and so slots have been deprecated in Svelte 5.\n\n---\n\n## {@render ...}\n\nTo render a [snippet](snippet), use a `{@render ...}` tag.\n\n```svelte\n{#snippet sum(a, b)}\n\t<p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}</p>\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render sum(1, 2)}\n{@render sum(3, 4)}\n{@render sum(5, 6)}\n```\n\nThe expression can be an identifier like `sum`, or an arbitrary JavaScript expression:\n\n```svelte\n{@render (cool ? coolSnippet : lameSnippet)()}\n```\n\n## Optional snippets\n\nIf the snippet is potentially undefined — for example, because it's an incoming prop — then you can use optional chaining to only render it when it _is_ defined:\n\n```svelte\n{@render children?.()}\n```\n\nAlternatively, use an [`{#if ...}`](if) block with an `:else` clause to render fallback content:\n\n```svelte\n{#if children}\n\t{@render children()}\n{:else}\n\t<p>fallback content</p>\n{/if}\n```"

Create a snippet called `title` that takes a book title string as a parameter\n3. The snippet should display the book title in a `<span>` element with `data-testid=\"book-title\"`\n4. Use the `{@render ...}` syntax to render the snippet for each book title in a list\n5. Each rendered title should be wrapped in a `<li>` element with `data-testid=\"book-item\"`\n\n## Example HTML structure:\n\n```html\n<ul>\n  <li data-testid=\"book-item\">The Lord of the Rings</li>\n  <li data-testid=\"book-item\">To Kill a Mockingbird</li>\n  <li data-testid=\"book-item\">1984</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nPlease implement this component using Svelte 5 runes.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: When you have finished implementing the component, use the ResultWrite tool to output your final Svelte component code.

You cannot use rest parameters, however.\n\n## Snippet scope\n\nSnippets can be declared anywhere inside your component.

The concept is similar to slots in web components.\n\n### Implicit props\n\nAs an authoring convenience, snippets declared directly _inside_ a component implicitly become props _on_ the component ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3VSTa_aMBD8Kyu_SkAbCA-JSzBR20N_QXt6vIMTO8SqsY29tI2s_PcqTiB8vaPHs7MzuxuIZgdBMvJLo0QlOElIJZXwJHsLBBvb_XUASc7Mb9Yu_B-hsMMK5sUzvDQahUZPMkJ96aTFfKd3KA_WOISfrFACKmcOMFmk8TWUTjY73RFLoz1C5U4SPWzhrcN2GKDrlcGEWauEnyRwxCaDdQLWyVJksII2uaMWTDPNLtzX5YX8-kgua-GcHJVXI3u5WEPb0d83O03TMZSmfRzOkG1Db7mNacOL19JagVALxoWbztq-H8U6j0SaYp2P2BGbOyQ2v8PQIFMXLKRDk177pq0zf6d8bMrzwBdd0pamyPMb-IjNEzS2f86Gz_Dwf-2F9nvNSUJQ_EOSoTuJNvngqK5v4Pas7n4-OCwlEEJcQTIMO-nSQwtb-GSdsX46e9gbRoP9yGQ11I0rEuycunu6PHx1QnPhxm3SFN15MOlYEFJZtf0dUywMbwZOeBGsrKNLYB54-1R9WNqVdki7usim6VmQphf7mnpshiQRhNAXdoOfMyX3OgMlKtz0cGEcF27uLSul3mewjPjgOOoDukxjPS9rqfh0pb-8zs6aBSt_7505aZ7B9xOi0T9YKW4UooVsr0zB1BTrWQJ3EL-oWcZ572GxFoezCk37QLe3897-B2i2U62uBAAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<!-- this is semantically the same as the above -->\n<Table data={fruits}>\n\t{#snippet header()}\n\t\t<th>fruit</th>\n\t\t<th>qty</th>\n\t\t<th>price</th>\n\t\t<th>total</th>\n\t{/snippet}\n\n\t{#snippet row(d)}\n\t\t<td>{d.name}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.qty}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.price}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.qty * d.price}</td>\n\t{/snippet}\n</Table>\n```\n\n### Implicit `children` snippet\n\nAny content inside the component tags that is _not_ a snippet declaration implicitly becomes part of the `children` snippet ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WOQQrCMBBFrzIMggql3ddY1Du4si5sOmIwnYRkFKX07lKqglqX8_7_w2uRDw1hjlsWI5ZqTPBoLEXMdy3K3fdZDzB5Ndfep_FKVnpWHSKNce1YiCVijirqYLwUJQOYxrsgsLmIOIZjcA1M02w4n-PpomSVvTclqyEutDX6DA2pZ7_ABIVugrmEC3XJH92P55_G39GodCmWBFrQJ2PrQAwdLGHig_NxNv9xrQa1dhWIawrv1Wzeqawa8953D-8QOmaEAQAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<!--- file: App.svelte --->\n<Button>click me</Button>\n```\n\n```svelte\n<!--- file: Button.svelte --->\n<script>\n\tlet { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n<!-- result will be <button>click me</button> -->\n<button>{@render children()}</button>\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] Note that you cannot have a prop called `children` if you also have content inside the component — for this reason, you should avoid having props with that name\n\n### Optional snippet props\n\nYou can declare snippet props as being optional. You can either use optional chaining to not render anything if the snippet isn't set...\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    let { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{@render children?.()}\n```\n\n...or use an `#if` block to render fallback content:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    let { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{#if children}\n    {@render children()}\n{:else}\n    fallback content\n{/if}\n```\n\n## Typing snippets\n\nSnippets implement the `Snippet` interface imported from `'svelte'`:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\">\n\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\n\n\tinterface Props {\n\t\tdata: any[];\n\t\tchildren: Snippet;\n\t\trow: Snippet<[any]>;\n\t}\n\n\tlet { data, children, row }: Props = $props();\n</script>\n```\n\nWith this change, red squigglies will appear if you try and use the component without providing a `data` prop and a `row` snippet. Notice that the type argument provided to `Snippet` is a tuple, since snippets can have multiple parameters.\n\nWe can tighten things up further by declaring a generic, so that `data` and `row` refer to the same type:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\" generics=\"T\">\n\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\n\n\tlet {\n\t\tdata,\n\t\tchildren,\n\t\trow\n\t}: {\n\t\tdata: T[];\n\t\tchildren: Snippet;\n\t\trow: Snippet<[T]>;\n\t} = $props();\n</script>\n```\n\n## Exporting snippets\n\nSnippets declared at the top level of a `.svelte` file can be exported from a `<script module>` for use in other components, provided they don't reference any declarations in a non-module `<script>` (whether directly or indirectly, via other snippets) ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WPwY7CMAxEf8UyB1hRgdhjl13Bga8gHFJipEqtGyUGFUX5dxJUtEB3b9bYM_MckHVLWOKut50TMuC5tpbEY4GnuiGP5T6gXG0-ykLSB8vW2oW_UCNZq7Snv_Rjx0Kc4kpc-6OrrfwoVlK3uQ4CaGMgwsl1LUwXy0f54J9-KV4vf20cNo7YkMu22aqAz4-oOLUI9YKluDPF4h_at-hX5PFyzA1tZ84N3fGpf8YfUU6GvDumLqDKmEqCjjCHUEX4hqDTWCU5PJ6Or38c4g1cPu9tnAEAAA==)):\n\n```svelte\n<script module>\n\texport { add };\n</script>\n\n{#snippet add(a, b)}\n\t{a} + {b} = {a + b}\n{/snippet}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This requires Svelte 5.5.0 or newer\n\n## Programmatic snippets\n\nSnippets can be created programmatically with the [`createRawSnippet`](svelte#createRawSnippet) API. This is intended for advanced use cases.\n\n## Snippets and slots\n\nIn Svelte 4, content can be passed to components using [slots](legacy-slots). Snippets are more powerful and flexible, and so slots have been deprecated in Svelte 5.\n\n---\n\n## {@render ...}\n\nTo render a [snippet](snippet), use a `{@render ...}` tag.\n\n```svelte\n{#snippet sum(a, b)}\n\t<p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}</p>\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render sum(1, 2)}\n{@render sum(3, 4)}\n{@render sum(5, 6)}\n```\n\nThe expression can be an identifier like `sum`, or an arbitrary JavaScript expression:\n\n```svelte\n{@render (cool ? coolSnippet : lameSnippet)()}\n```\n\n## Optional snippets\n\nIf the snippet is potentially undefined — for example, because it's an incoming prop — then you can use optional chaining to only render it when it _is_ defined:\n\n```svelte\n{@render children?.()}\n```\n\nAlternatively, use an [`{#if ...}`](if) block with an `:else` clause to render fallback content:\n\n```svelte\n{#if children}\n\t{@render children()}\n{:else}\n\t<p>fallback content</p>\n{/if}\n```"

Create a snippet called `title` that takes a book title string as a parameter\n3. The snippet should display the book title in a `<span>` element with `data-testid=\"book-title\"`\n4. Use the `{@render ...}` syntax to render the snippet for each book title in a list\n5.

You cannot use rest parameters, however.\n\n## Snippet scope\n\nSnippets can be declared anywhere inside your component. They can reference values declared outside themselves, for example in the `<script>` tag or in `{#each ...}` blocks ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE12P0QrCMAxFfyWrwhSEvc8p-h1OcG5RC10bmkyQ0n-3HQPBx3vCPUmCemiDrOpLULYbUdXqTKR2Sj6UA7_RCKbMbvJ9Jg33XpMcW9uKQYEAIzJ3T4QD3LSUDE-PnYA4YET4uOkGMc3W5B3xZrtvbVP9HDas2GqiZHqhMW6Tr9jGbG_oOCMImcUCwrIpFk1FqRyqpRpn0cmjHdAvnrIzuscyq_4nd3dPPD01ukE_NA6qFj9hvMYvGjJADw8BAAA=))...\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet { message = `it's great to see you!` } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{#snippet hello(name)}\n\t<p>hello {name}! {message}!</p>\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render hello('alice')}\n{@render hello('bob')}\n```\n\n...and they are 'visible' to everything in the same lexical scope (i.e. siblings, and children of those siblings):\n\n```svelte\n<div>\n\t{#snippet x()}\n\t\t{#snippet y()}...{/snippet}\n\n\t\t<!-- this is fine -->\n\t\t{@render y()}\n\t{/snippet}\n\n\t<!-- this will error, as `y` is not in scope -->\n\t{@render y()}\n</div>\n\n<!-- this will also error, as `x` is not in scope -->\n{@render x()}\n```\n\nSnippets can reference themselves and each other ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE2WPTQqDMBCFrxLiRqH1Zysi7TlqF1YnENBJSGJLCYGeo5tesUeosfYH3c2bee_jjaWMd6BpfrAU6x5oTvdS0g01V-mFPkNnYNRaDKrxGxto5FKCIaeu1kYwFkauwsoUWtZYPh_3W5FMY4U2mb3egL9kIwY0rbhgiO-sDTgjSEqSTvIDs-jiOP7i_MHuFGAL6p9BtiSbOTl0GtzCuihqE87cqtyam6WRGz_vRcsZh5bmRg3gju4Fptq_kzQBAAA=)):\n\n```svelte\n{#snippet blastoff()}\n\t<span>🚀</span>\n{/snippet}\n\n{#snippet countdown(n)}\n\t{#if n > 0}\n\t\t<span>{n}...</span>\n\t\t{@render countdown(n - 1)}\n\t{:else}\n\t\t{@render blastoff()}\n\t{/if}\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render countdown(10)}\n```\n\n## Passing snippets to components\n\n### Explicit props\n\nWithin the template, snippets are values just like any other. As such, they can be passed to components as props ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3VS247aMBD9lZGpBGwDASRegonaPvQL2qdlH5zYEKvBNvbQLbL875VzAcKyj3PmzJnLGU8UOwqSkd8KJdaCk4TsZS0cyV49wYuJuQiQpGd-N2bu_ooaI1YwJ57hpVYoFDqSEepKKw3mO7VDeTTaIvxiRS1gb_URxvO0ibrS8WanIrHUyiHs7Vmigy28RmyHHmKvDMbMmFq4cQInvGSwTsBYWYoMVhCSB2rBFFPsyl0uruTlR3JZCWvlTXl1Yy_mawiR_rbZKZrellJ-5JQ0RiBUgnFhJ9OGR7HKmwVoilXeIye8DOJGfYCgRlZ3iE876TBsZPX7hPdteO75PC4QaIo8vwNPePmANQ2fMeEFHrLD7rR1jTNkW986E8C3KwfwVr8HSHOSEBT_kGRozyIkn_zQveXDL3rIfPJHtUDwzShJd_Qk3gQCbOGLsdq4yfTRJopRuin3I7nv6kL7ARRjmLdBDG3uv1mhuLA3V2mKtqNEf_oCn8p9aN-WYqH5peP4kWBl1UwJzAEPT9U7K--0fRrrWnPTXpCm1_EVdXjpNmlA8G1hPPyM1fKgMqjFHjctXGjLhZ05w0qpDhksGrybuNEHtJnCalZWsuaTlfq6nPaaBSv_HKw-K57BjzOiVj9ZKQYKzQjZodYFqydYTRN4gPhVzTDO2xnma3HsVWjaLjT8nbfwHy7Q5f2dBAAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\timport Table from './Table.svelte';\n\n\tconst fruits = [\n\t\t{ name: 'apples', qty: 5, price: 2 },\n\t\t{ name: 'bananas', qty: 10, price: 1 },\n\t\t{ name: 'cherries', qty: 20, price: 0.5 }\n\t];\n</script>\n\n{#snippet header()}\n\t<th>fruit</th>\n\t<th>qty</th>\n\t<th>price</th>\n\t<th>total</th>\n{/snippet}\n\n{#snippet row(d)}\n\t<td>{d.name}</td>\n\t<td>{d.qty}</td>\n\t<td>{d.price}</td>\n\t<td>{d.qty * d.price}</td>\n{/snippet}\n\n<Table data={fruits} {header} {row} />\n```\n\nThink about it like passing content instead of data to a component. The concept is similar to slots in web components.\n\n### Implicit props\n\nAs an authoring convenience, snippets declared directly _inside_ a component implicitly become props _on_ the component ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3VSTa_aMBD8Kyu_SkAbCA-JSzBR20N_QXt6vIMTO8SqsY29tI2s_PcqTiB8vaPHs7MzuxuIZgdBMvJLo0QlOElIJZXwJHsLBBvb_XUASc7Mb9Yu_B-hsMMK5sUzvDQahUZPMkJ96aTFfKd3KA_WOISfrFACKmcOMFmk8TWUTjY73RFLoz1C5U4SPWzhrcN2GKDrlcGEWauEnyRwxCaDdQLWyVJksII2uaMWTDPNLtzX5YX8-kgua-GcHJVXI3u5WEPb0d83O03TMZSmfRzOkG1Db7mNacOL19JagVALxoWbztq-H8U6j0SaYp2P2BGbOyQ2v8PQIFMXLKRDk177pq0zf6d8bMrzwBdd0pamyPMb-IjNEzS2f86Gz_Dwf-2F9nvNSUJQ_EOSoTuJNvngqK5v4Pas7n4-OCwlEEJcQTIMO-nSQwtb-GSdsX46e9gbRoP9yGQ11I0rEuycunu6PHx1QnPhxm3SFN15MOlYEFJZtf0dUywMbwZOeBGsrKNLYB54-1R9WNqVdki7usim6VmQphf7mnpshiQRhNAXdoOfMyX3OgMlKtz0cGEcF27uLSul3mewjPjgOOoDukxjPS9rqfh0pb-8zs6aBSt_7505aZ7B9xOi0T9YKW4UooVsr0zB1BTrWQJ3EL-oWcZ572GxFoezCk37QLe3897-B2i2U62uBAAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<!-- this is semantically the same as the above -->\n<Table data={fruits}>\n\t{#snippet header()}\n\t\t<th>fruit</th>\n\t\t<th>qty</th>\n\t\t<th>price</th>\n\t\t<th>total</th>\n\t{/snippet}\n\n\t{#snippet row(d)}\n\t\t<td>{d.name}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.qty}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.price}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.qty * d.price}</td>\n\t{/snippet}\n</Table>\n```\n\n### Implicit `children` snippet\n\nAny content inside the component tags that is _not_ a snippet declaration implicitly becomes part of the `children` snippet ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WOQQrCMBBFrzIMggql3ddY1Du4si5sOmIwnYRkFKX07lKqglqX8_7_w2uRDw1hjlsWI5ZqTPBoLEXMdy3K3fdZDzB5Ndfep_FKVnpWHSKNce1YiCVijirqYLwUJQOYxrsgsLmIOIZjcA1M02w4n-PpomSVvTclqyEutDX6DA2pZ7_ABIVugrmEC3XJH92P55_G39GodCmWBFrQJ2PrQAwdLGHig_NxNv9xrQa1dhWIawrv1Wzeqawa8953D-8QOmaEAQAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<!--- file: App.svelte --->\n<Button>click me</Button>\n```\n\n```svelte\n<!--- file: Button.svelte --->\n<script>\n\tlet { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n<!-- result will be <button>click me</button> -->\n<button>{@render children()}</button>\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] Note that you cannot have a prop called `children` if you also have content inside the component — for this reason, you should avoid having props with that name\n\n### Optional snippet props\n\nYou can declare snippet props as being optional. You can either use optional chaining to not render anything if the snippet isn't set...\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    let { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{@render children?.()}\n```\n\n...or use an `#if` block to render fallback content:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    let { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{#if children}\n    {@render children()}\n{:else}\n    fallback content\n{/if}\n```\n\n## Typing snippets\n\nSnippets implement the `Snippet` interface imported from `'svelte'`:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\">\n\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\n\n\tinterface Props {\n\t\tdata: any[];\n\t\tchildren: Snippet;\n\t\trow: Snippet<[any]>;\n\t}\n\n\tlet { data, children, row }: Props = $props();\n</script>\n```\n\nWith this change, red squigglies will appear if you try and use the component without providing a `data` prop and a `row` snippet. Notice that the type argument provided to `Snippet` is a tuple, since snippets can have multiple parameters.\n\nWe can tighten things up further by declaring a generic, so that `data` and `row` refer to the same type:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\" generics=\"T\">\n\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\n\n\tlet {\n\t\tdata,\n\t\tchildren,\n\t\trow\n\t}: {\n\t\tdata: T[];\n\t\tchildren: Snippet;\n\t\trow: Snippet<[T]>;\n\t} = $props();\n</script>\n```\n\n## Exporting snippets\n\nSnippets declared at the top level of a `.svelte` file can be exported from a `<script module>` for use in other components, provided they don't reference any declarations in a non-module `<script>` (whether directly or indirectly, via other snippets) ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WPwY7CMAxEf8UyB1hRgdhjl13Bga8gHFJipEqtGyUGFUX5dxJUtEB3b9bYM_MckHVLWOKut50TMuC5tpbEY4GnuiGP5T6gXG0-ykLSB8vW2oW_UCNZq7Snv_Rjx0Kc4kpc-6OrrfwoVlK3uQ4CaGMgwsl1LUwXy0f54J9-KV4vf20cNo7YkMu22aqAz4-oOLUI9YKluDPF4h_at-hX5PFyzA1tZ84N3fGpf8YfUU6GvDumLqDKmEqCjjCHUEX4hqDTWCU5PJ6Or38c4g1cPu9tnAEAAA==)):\n\n```svelte\n<script module>\n\texport { add };\n</script>\n\n{#snippet add(a, b)}\n\t{a} + {b} = {a + b}\n{/snippet}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This requires Svelte 5.5.0 or newer\n\n## Programmatic snippets\n\nSnippets can be created programmatically with the [`createRawSnippet`](svelte#createRawSnippet) API. This is intended for advanced use cases.\n\n## Snippets and slots\n\nIn Svelte 4, content can be passed to components using [slots](legacy-slots). Snippets are more powerful and flexible, and so slots have been deprecated in Svelte 5.\n\n---\n\n## {@render ...}\n\nTo render a [snippet](snippet), use a `{@render ...}` tag.\n\n```svelte\n{#snippet sum(a, b)}\n\t<p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}</p>\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render sum(1, 2)}\n{@render sum(3, 4)}\n{@render sum(5, 6)}\n```\n\nThe expression can be an identifier like `sum`, or an arbitrary JavaScript expression:\n\n```svelte\n{@render (cool ? coolSnippet : lameSnippet)()}\n```\n\n## Optional snippets\n\nIf the snippet is potentially undefined — for example, because it's an incoming prop — then you can use optional chaining to only render it when it _is_ defined:\n\n```svelte\n{@render children?.()}\n```\n\nAlternatively, use an [`{#if ...}`](if) block with an `:else` clause to render fallback content:\n\n```svelte\n{#if children}\n\t{@render children()}\n{:else}\n\t<p>fallback content</p>\n{/if}\n```"

You cannot use rest parameters, however.\n\n## Snippet scope\n\nSnippets can be declared anywhere inside your component.

The concept is similar to slots in web components.\n\n### Implicit props\n\nAs an authoring convenience, snippets declared directly _inside_ a component implicitly become props _on_ the component ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3VSTa_aMBD8Kyu_SkAbCA-JSzBR20N_QXt6vIMTO8SqsY29tI2s_PcqTiB8vaPHs7MzuxuIZgdBMvJLo0QlOElIJZXwJHsLBBvb_XUASc7Mb9Yu_B-hsMMK5sUzvDQahUZPMkJ96aTFfKd3KA_WOISfrFACKmcOMFmk8TWUTjY73RFLoz1C5U4SPWzhrcN2GKDrlcGEWauEnyRwxCaDdQLWyVJksII2uaMWTDPNLtzX5YX8-kgua-GcHJVXI3u5WEPb0d83O03TMZSmfRzOkG1Db7mNacOL19JagVALxoWbztq-H8U6j0SaYp2P2BGbOyQ2v8PQIFMXLKRDk177pq0zf6d8bMrzwBdd0pamyPMb-IjNEzS2f86Gz_Dwf-2F9nvNSUJQ_EOSoTuJNvngqK5v4Pas7n4-OCwlEEJcQTIMO-nSQwtb-GSdsX46e9gbRoP9yGQ11I0rEuycunu6PHx1QnPhxm3SFN15MOlYEFJZtf0dUywMbwZOeBGsrKNLYB54-1R9WNqVdki7usim6VmQphf7mnpshiQRhNAXdoOfMyX3OgMlKtz0cGEcF27uLSul3mewjPjgOOoDukxjPS9rqfh0pb-8zs6aBSt_7505aZ7B9xOi0T9YKW4UooVsr0zB1BTrWQJ3EL-oWcZ572GxFoezCk37QLe3897-B2i2U62uBAAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<!-- this is semantically the same as the above -->\n<Table data={fruits}>\n\t{#snippet header()}\n\t\t<th>fruit</th>\n\t\t<th>qty</th>\n\t\t<th>price</th>\n\t\t<th>total</th>\n\t{/snippet}\n\n\t{#snippet row(d)}\n\t\t<td>{d.name}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.qty}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.price}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.qty * d.price}</td>\n\t{/snippet}\n</Table>\n```\n\n### Implicit `children` snippet\n\nAny content inside the component tags that is _not_ a snippet declaration implicitly becomes part of the `children` snippet ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WOQQrCMBBFrzIMggql3ddY1Du4si5sOmIwnYRkFKX07lKqglqX8_7_w2uRDw1hjlsWI5ZqTPBoLEXMdy3K3fdZDzB5Ndfep_FKVnpWHSKNce1YiCVijirqYLwUJQOYxrsgsLmIOIZjcA1M02w4n-PpomSVvTclqyEutDX6DA2pZ7_ABIVugrmEC3XJH92P55_G39GodCmWBFrQJ2PrQAwdLGHig_NxNv9xrQa1dhWIawrv1Wzeqawa8953D-8QOmaEAQAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<!--- file: App.svelte --->\n<Button>click me</Button>\n```\n\n```svelte\n<!--- file: Button.svelte --->\n<script>\n\tlet { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n<!-- result will be <button>click me</button> -->\n<button>{@render children()}</button>\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] Note that you cannot have a prop called `children` if you also have content inside the component — for this reason, you should avoid having props with that name\n\n### Optional snippet props\n\nYou can declare snippet props as being optional. You can either use optional chaining to not render anything if the snippet isn't set...\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    let { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{@render children?.()}\n```\n\n...or use an `#if` block to render fallback content:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    let { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{#if children}\n    {@render children()}\n{:else}\n    fallback content\n{/if}\n```\n\n## Typing snippets\n\nSnippets implement the `Snippet` interface imported from `'svelte'`:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\">\n\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\n\n\tinterface Props {\n\t\tdata: any[];\n\t\tchildren: Snippet;\n\t\trow: Snippet<[any]>;\n\t}\n\n\tlet { data, children, row }: Props = $props();\n</script>\n```\n\nWith this change, red squigglies will appear if you try and use the component without providing a `data` prop and a `row` snippet. Notice that the type argument provided to `Snippet` is a tuple, since snippets can have multiple parameters.\n\nWe can tighten things up further by declaring a generic, so that `data` and `row` refer to the same type:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\" generics=\"T\">\n\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\n\n\tlet {\n\t\tdata,\n\t\tchildren,\n\t\trow\n\t}: {\n\t\tdata: T[];\n\t\tchildren: Snippet;\n\t\trow: Snippet<[T]>;\n\t} = $props();\n</script>\n```\n\n## Exporting snippets\n\nSnippets declared at the top level of a `.svelte` file can be exported from a `<script module>` for use in other components, provided they don't reference any declarations in a non-module `<script>` (whether directly or indirectly, via other snippets) ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WPwY7CMAxEf8UyB1hRgdhjl13Bga8gHFJipEqtGyUGFUX5dxJUtEB3b9bYM_MckHVLWOKut50TMuC5tpbEY4GnuiGP5T6gXG0-ykLSB8vW2oW_UCNZq7Snv_Rjx0Kc4kpc-6OrrfwoVlK3uQ4CaGMgwsl1LUwXy0f54J9-KV4vf20cNo7YkMu22aqAz4-oOLUI9YKluDPF4h_at-hX5PFyzA1tZ84N3fGpf8YfUU6GvDumLqDKmEqCjjCHUEX4hqDTWCU5PJ6Or38c4g1cPu9tnAEAAA==)):\n\n```svelte\n<script module>\n\texport { add };\n</script>\n\n{#snippet add(a, b)}\n\t{a} + {b} = {a + b}\n{/snippet}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This requires Svelte 5.5.0 or newer\n\n## Programmatic snippets\n\nSnippets can be created programmatically with the [`createRawSnippet`](svelte#createRawSnippet) API. This is intended for advanced use cases.\n\n## Snippets and slots\n\nIn Svelte 4, content can be passed to components using [slots](legacy-slots). Snippets are more powerful and flexible, and so slots have been deprecated in Svelte 5.\n\n---\n\n## {@render ...}\n\nTo render a [snippet](snippet), use a `{@render ...}` tag.\n\n```svelte\n{#snippet sum(a, b)}\n\t<p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}</p>\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render sum(1, 2)}\n{@render sum(3, 4)}\n{@render sum(5, 6)}\n```\n\nThe expression can be an identifier like `sum`, or an arbitrary JavaScript expression:\n\n```svelte\n{@render (cool ? coolSnippet : lameSnippet)()}\n```\n\n## Optional snippets\n\nIf the snippet is potentially undefined — for example, because it's an incoming prop — then you can use optional chaining to only render it when it _is_ defined:\n\n```svelte\n{@render children?.()}\n```\n\nAlternatively, use an [`{#if ...}`](if) block with an `:else` clause to render fallback content:\n\n```svelte\n{#if children}\n\t{@render children()}\n{:else}\n\t<p>fallback content</p>\n{/if}\n```"

Create a snippet called `title` that takes a book title string as a parameter\n3. The snippet should display the book title in a `<span>` element with `data-testid=\"book-title\"`\n4. Use the `{@render ...}` syntax to render the snippet for each book title in a list\n5.

You cannot use rest parameters, however.\n\n## Snippet scope\n\nSnippets can be declared anywhere inside your component. They can reference values declared outside themselves, for example in the `<script>` tag or in `{#each ...}` blocks ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE12P0QrCMAxFfyWrwhSEvc8p-h1OcG5RC10bmkyQ0n-3HQPBx3vCPUmCemiDrOpLULYbUdXqTKR2Sj6UA7_RCKbMbvJ9Jg33XpMcW9uKQYEAIzJ3T4QD3LSUDE-PnYA4YET4uOkGMc3W5B3xZrtvbVP9HDas2GqiZHqhMW6Tr9jGbG_oOCMImcUCwrIpFk1FqRyqpRpn0cmjHdAvnrIzuscyq_4nd3dPPD01ukE_NA6qFj9hvMYvGjJADw8BAAA=))...\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet { message = `it's great to see you!` } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{#snippet hello(name)}\n\t<p>hello {name}! {message}!</p>\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render hello('alice')}\n{@render hello('bob')}\n```\n\n...and they are 'visible' to everything in the same lexical scope (i.e. siblings, and children of those siblings):\n\n```svelte\n<div>\n\t{#snippet x()}\n\t\t{#snippet y()}...{/snippet}\n\n\t\t<!-- this is fine -->\n\t\t{@render y()}\n\t{/snippet}\n\n\t<!-- this will error, as `y` is not in scope -->\n\t{@render y()}\n</div>\n\n<!-- this will also error, as `x` is not in scope -->\n{@render x()}\n```\n\nSnippets can reference themselves and each other ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE2WPTQqDMBCFrxLiRqH1Zysi7TlqF1YnENBJSGJLCYGeo5tesUeosfYH3c2bee_jjaWMd6BpfrAU6x5oTvdS0g01V-mFPkNnYNRaDKrxGxto5FKCIaeu1kYwFkauwsoUWtZYPh_3W5FMY4U2mb3egL9kIwY0rbhgiO-sDTgjSEqSTvIDs-jiOP7i_MHuFGAL6p9BtiSbOTl0GtzCuihqE87cqtyam6WRGz_vRcsZh5bmRg3gju4Fptq_kzQBAAA=)):\n\n```svelte\n{#snippet blastoff()}\n\t<span>🚀</span>\n{/snippet}\n\n{#snippet countdown(n)}\n\t{#if n > 0}\n\t\t<span>{n}...</span>\n\t\t{@render countdown(n - 1)}\n\t{:else}\n\t\t{@render blastoff()}\n\t{/if}\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render countdown(10)}\n```\n\n## Passing snippets to components\n\n### Explicit props\n\nWithin the template, snippets are values just like any other. As such, they can be passed to components as props ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3VS247aMBD9lZGpBGwDASRegonaPvQL2qdlH5zYEKvBNvbQLbL875VzAcKyj3PmzJnLGU8UOwqSkd8KJdaCk4TsZS0cyV49wYuJuQiQpGd-N2bu_ooaI1YwJ57hpVYoFDqSEepKKw3mO7VDeTTaIvxiRS1gb_URxvO0ibrS8WanIrHUyiHs7Vmigy28RmyHHmKvDMbMmFq4cQInvGSwTsBYWYoMVhCSB2rBFFPsyl0uruTlR3JZCWvlTXl1Yy_mawiR_rbZKZrellJ-5JQ0RiBUgnFhJ9OGR7HKmwVoilXeIye8DOJGfYCgRlZ3iE876TBsZPX7hPdteO75PC4QaIo8vwNPePmANQ2fMeEFHrLD7rR1jTNkW986E8C3KwfwVr8HSHOSEBT_kGRozyIkn_zQveXDL3rIfPJHtUDwzShJd_Qk3gQCbOGLsdq4yfTRJopRuin3I7nv6kL7ARRjmLdBDG3uv1mhuLA3V2mKtqNEf_oCn8p9aN-WYqH5peP4kWBl1UwJzAEPT9U7K--0fRrrWnPTXpCm1_EVdXjpNmlA8G1hPPyM1fKgMqjFHjctXGjLhZ05w0qpDhksGrybuNEHtJnCalZWsuaTlfq6nPaaBSv_HKw-K57BjzOiVj9ZKQYKzQjZodYFqydYTRN4gPhVzTDO2xnma3HsVWjaLjT8nbfwHy7Q5f2dBAAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\timport Table from './Table.svelte';\n\n\tconst fruits = [\n\t\t{ name: 'apples', qty: 5, price: 2 },\n\t\t{ name: 'bananas', qty: 10, price: 1 },\n\t\t{ name: 'cherries', qty: 20, price: 0.5 }\n\t];\n</script>\n\n{#snippet header()}\n\t<th>fruit</th>\n\t<th>qty</th>\n\t<th>price</th>\n\t<th>total</th>\n{/snippet}\n\n{#snippet row(d)}\n\t<td>{d.name}</td>\n\t<td>{d.qty}</td>\n\t<td>{d.price}</td>\n\t<td>{d.qty * d.price}</td>\n{/snippet}\n\n<Table data={fruits} {header} {row} />\n```\n\nThink about it like passing content instead of data to a component. The concept is similar to slots in web components.\n\n### Implicit props\n\nAs an authoring convenience, snippets declared directly _inside_ a component implicitly become props _on_ the component ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3VSTa_aMBD8Kyu_SkAbCA-JSzBR20N_QXt6vIMTO8SqsY29tI2s_PcqTiB8vaPHs7MzuxuIZgdBMvJLo0QlOElIJZXwJHsLBBvb_XUASc7Mb9Yu_B-hsMMK5sUzvDQahUZPMkJ96aTFfKd3KA_WOISfrFACKmcOMFmk8TWUTjY73RFLoz1C5U4SPWzhrcN2GKDrlcGEWauEnyRwxCaDdQLWyVJksII2uaMWTDPNLtzX5YX8-kgua-GcHJVXI3u5WEPb0d83O03TMZSmfRzOkG1Db7mNacOL19JagVALxoWbztq-H8U6j0SaYp2P2BGbOyQ2v8PQIFMXLKRDk177pq0zf6d8bMrzwBdd0pamyPMb-IjNEzS2f86Gz_Dwf-2F9nvNSUJQ_EOSoTuJNvngqK5v4Pas7n4-OCwlEEJcQTIMO-nSQwtb-GSdsX46e9gbRoP9yGQ11I0rEuycunu6PHx1QnPhxm3SFN15MOlYEFJZtf0dUywMbwZOeBGsrKNLYB54-1R9WNqVdki7usim6VmQphf7mnpshiQRhNAXdoOfMyX3OgMlKtz0cGEcF27uLSul3mewjPjgOOoDukxjPS9rqfh0pb-8zs6aBSt_7505aZ7B9xOi0T9YKW4UooVsr0zB1BTrWQJ3EL-oWcZ572GxFoezCk37QLe3897-B2i2U62uBAAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<!-- this is semantically the same as the above -->\n<Table data={fruits}>\n\t{#snippet header()}\n\t\t<th>fruit</th>\n\t\t<th>qty</th>\n\t\t<th>price</th>\n\t\t<th>total</th>\n\t{/snippet}\n\n\t{#snippet row(d)}\n\t\t<td>{d.name}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.qty}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.price}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.qty * d.price}</td>\n\t{/snippet}\n</Table>\n```\n\n### Implicit `children` snippet\n\nAny content inside the component tags that is _not_ a snippet declaration implicitly becomes part of the `children` snippet ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WOQQrCMBBFrzIMggql3ddY1Du4si5sOmIwnYRkFKX07lKqglqX8_7_w2uRDw1hjlsWI5ZqTPBoLEXMdy3K3fdZDzB5Ndfep_FKVnpWHSKNce1YiCVijirqYLwUJQOYxrsgsLmIOIZjcA1M02w4n-PpomSVvTclqyEutDX6DA2pZ7_ABIVugrmEC3XJH92P55_G39GodCmWBFrQJ2PrQAwdLGHig_NxNv9xrQa1dhWIawrv1Wzeqawa8953D-8QOmaEAQAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<!--- file: App.svelte --->\n<Button>click me</Button>\n```\n\n```svelte\n<!--- file: Button.svelte --->\n<script>\n\tlet { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n<!-- result will be <button>click me</button> -->\n<button>{@render children()}</button>\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] Note that you cannot have a prop called `children` if you also have content inside the component — for this reason, you should avoid having props with that name\n\n### Optional snippet props\n\nYou can declare snippet props as being optional. You can either use optional chaining to not render anything if the snippet isn't set...\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    let { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{@render children?.()}\n```\n\n...or use an `#if` block to render fallback content:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    let { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{#if children}\n    {@render children()}\n{:else}\n    fallback content\n{/if}\n```\n\n## Typing snippets\n\nSnippets implement the `Snippet` interface imported from `'svelte'`:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\">\n\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\n\n\tinterface Props {\n\t\tdata: any[];\n\t\tchildren: Snippet;\n\t\trow: Snippet<[any]>;\n\t}\n\n\tlet { data, children, row }: Props = $props();\n</script>\n```\n\nWith this change, red squigglies will appear if you try and use the component without providing a `data` prop and a `row` snippet. Notice that the type argument provided to `Snippet` is a tuple, since snippets can have multiple parameters.\n\nWe can tighten things up further by declaring a generic, so that `data` and `row` refer to the same type:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\" generics=\"T\">\n\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\n\n\tlet {\n\t\tdata,\n\t\tchildren,\n\t\trow\n\t}: {\n\t\tdata: T[];\n\t\tchildren: Snippet;\n\t\trow: Snippet<[T]>;\n\t} = $props();\n</script>\n```\n\n## Exporting snippets\n\nSnippets declared at the top level of a `.svelte` file can be exported from a `<script module>` for use in other components, provided they don't reference any declarations in a non-module `<script>` (whether directly or indirectly, via other snippets) ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WPwY7CMAxEf8UyB1hRgdhjl13Bga8gHFJipEqtGyUGFUX5dxJUtEB3b9bYM_MckHVLWOKut50TMuC5tpbEY4GnuiGP5T6gXG0-ykLSB8vW2oW_UCNZq7Snv_Rjx0Kc4kpc-6OrrfwoVlK3uQ4CaGMgwsl1LUwXy0f54J9-KV4vf20cNo7YkMu22aqAz4-oOLUI9YKluDPF4h_at-hX5PFyzA1tZ84N3fGpf8YfUU6GvDumLqDKmEqCjjCHUEX4hqDTWCU5PJ6Or38c4g1cPu9tnAEAAA==)):\n\n```svelte\n<script module>\n\texport { add };\n</script>\n\n{#snippet add(a, b)}\n\t{a} + {b} = {a + b}\n{/snippet}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This requires Svelte 5.5.0 or newer\n\n## Programmatic snippets\n\nSnippets can be created programmatically with the [`createRawSnippet`](svelte#createRawSnippet) API. This is intended for advanced use cases.\n\n## Snippets and slots\n\nIn Svelte 4, content can be passed to components using [slots](legacy-slots). Snippets are more powerful and flexible, and so slots have been deprecated in Svelte 5.\n\n---\n\n## {@render ...}\n\nTo render a [snippet](snippet), use a `{@render ...}` tag.\n\n```svelte\n{#snippet sum(a, b)}\n\t<p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}</p>\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render sum(1, 2)}\n{@render sum(3, 4)}\n{@render sum(5, 6)}\n```\n\nThe expression can be an identifier like `sum`, or an arbitrary JavaScript expression:\n\n```svelte\n{@render (cool ? coolSnippet : lameSnippet)()}\n```\n\n## Optional snippets\n\nIf the snippet is potentially undefined — for example, because it's an incoming prop — then you can use optional chaining to only render it when it _is_ defined:\n\n```svelte\n{@render children?.()}\n```\n\nAlternatively, use an [`{#if ...}`](if) block with an `:else` clause to render fallback content:\n\n```svelte\n{#if children}\n\t{@render children()}\n{:else}\n\t<p>fallback content</p>\n{/if}\n```"

You cannot use rest parameters, however.\n\n## Snippet scope\n\nSnippets can be declared anywhere inside your component. They can reference values declared outside themselves, for example in the `<script>` tag or in `{#each ...}` blocks ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE12P0QrCMAxFfyWrwhSEvc8p-h1OcG5RC10bmkyQ0n-3HQPBx3vCPUmCemiDrOpLULYbUdXqTKR2Sj6UA7_RCKbMbvJ9Jg33XpMcW9uKQYEAIzJ3T4QD3LSUDE-PnYA4YET4uOkGMc3W5B3xZrtvbVP9HDas2GqiZHqhMW6Tr9jGbG_oOCMImcUCwrIpFk1FqRyqpRpn0cmjHdAvnrIzuscyq_4nd3dPPD01ukE_NA6qFj9hvMYvGjJADw8BAAA=))...\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet { message = `it's great to see you!` } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{#snippet hello(name)}\n\t<p>hello {name}! {message}!</p>\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render hello('alice')}\n{@render hello('bob')}\n```\n\n...and they are 'visible' to everything in the same lexical scope (i.e. siblings, and children of those siblings):\n\n```svelte\n<div>\n\t{#snippet x()}\n\t\t{#snippet y()}...{/snippet}\n\n\t\t<!-- this is fine -->\n\t\t{@render y()}\n\t{/snippet}\n\n\t<!-- this will error, as `y` is not in scope -->\n\t{@render y()}\n</div>\n\n<!-- this will also error, as `x` is not in scope -->\n{@render x()}\n```\n\nSnippets can reference themselves and each other ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE2WPTQqDMBCFrxLiRqH1Zysi7TlqF1YnENBJSGJLCYGeo5tesUeosfYH3c2bee_jjaWMd6BpfrAU6x5oTvdS0g01V-mFPkNnYNRaDKrxGxto5FKCIaeu1kYwFkauwsoUWtZYPh_3W5FMY4U2mb3egL9kIwY0rbhgiO-sDTgjSEqSTvIDs-jiOP7i_MHuFGAL6p9BtiSbOTl0GtzCuihqE87cqtyam6WRGz_vRcsZh5bmRg3gju4Fptq_kzQBAAA=)):\n\n```svelte\n{#snippet blastoff()}\n\t<span>🚀</span>\n{/snippet}\n\n{#snippet countdown(n)}\n\t{#if n > 0}\n\t\t<span>{n}...</span>\n\t\t{@render countdown(n - 1)}\n\t{:else}\n\t\t{@render blastoff()}\n\t{/if}\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render countdown(10)}\n```\n\n## Passing snippets to components\n\n### Explicit props\n\nWithin the template, snippets are values just like any other. As such, they can be passed to components as props ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3VS247aMBD9lZGpBGwDASRegonaPvQL2qdlH5zYEKvBNvbQLbL875VzAcKyj3PmzJnLGU8UOwqSkd8KJdaCk4TsZS0cyV49wYuJuQiQpGd-N2bu_ooaI1YwJ57hpVYoFDqSEepKKw3mO7VDeTTaIvxiRS1gb_URxvO0ibrS8WanIrHUyiHs7Vmigy28RmyHHmKvDMbMmFq4cQInvGSwTsBYWYoMVhCSB2rBFFPsyl0uruTlR3JZCWvlTXl1Yy_mawiR_rbZKZrellJ-5JQ0RiBUgnFhJ9OGR7HKmwVoilXeIye8DOJGfYCgRlZ3iE876TBsZPX7hPdteO75PC4QaIo8vwNPePmANQ2fMeEFHrLD7rR1jTNkW986E8C3KwfwVr8HSHOSEBT_kGRozyIkn_zQveXDL3rIfPJHtUDwzShJd_Qk3gQCbOGLsdq4yfTRJopRuin3I7nv6kL7ARRjmLdBDG3uv1mhuLA3V2mKtqNEf_oCn8p9aN-WYqH5peP4kWBl1UwJzAEPT9U7K--0fRrrWnPTXpCm1_EVdXjpNmlA8G1hPPyM1fKgMqjFHjctXGjLhZ05w0qpDhksGrybuNEHtJnCalZWsuaTlfq6nPaaBSv_HKw-K57BjzOiVj9ZKQYKzQjZodYFqydYTRN4gPhVzTDO2xnma3HsVWjaLjT8nbfwHy7Q5f2dBAAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\timport Table from './Table.svelte';\n\n\tconst fruits = [\n\t\t{ name: 'apples', qty: 5, price: 2 },\n\t\t{ name: 'bananas', qty: 10, price: 1 },\n\t\t{ name: 'cherries', qty: 20, price: 0.5 }\n\t];\n</script>\n\n{#snippet header()}\n\t<th>fruit</th>\n\t<th>qty</th>\n\t<th>price</th>\n\t<th>total</th>\n{/snippet}\n\n{#snippet row(d)}\n\t<td>{d.name}</td>\n\t<td>{d.qty}</td>\n\t<td>{d.price}</td>\n\t<td>{d.qty * d.price}</td>\n{/snippet}\n\n<Table data={fruits} {header} {row} />\n```\n\nThink about it like passing content instead of data to a component. The concept is similar to slots in web components.\n\n### Implicit props\n\nAs an authoring convenience, snippets declared directly _inside_ a component implicitly become props _on_ the component ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3VSTa_aMBD8Kyu_SkAbCA-JSzBR20N_QXt6vIMTO8SqsY29tI2s_PcqTiB8vaPHs7MzuxuIZgdBMvJLo0QlOElIJZXwJHsLBBvb_XUASc7Mb9Yu_B-hsMMK5sUzvDQahUZPMkJ96aTFfKd3KA_WOISfrFACKmcOMFmk8TWUTjY73RFLoz1C5U4SPWzhrcN2GKDrlcGEWauEnyRwxCaDdQLWyVJksII2uaMWTDPNLtzX5YX8-kgua-GcHJVXI3u5WEPb0d83O03TMZSmfRzOkG1Db7mNacOL19JagVALxoWbztq-H8U6j0SaYp2P2BGbOyQ2v8PQIFMXLKRDk177pq0zf6d8bMrzwBdd0pamyPMb-IjNEzS2f86Gz_Dwf-2F9nvNSUJQ_EOSoTuJNvngqK5v4Pas7n4-OCwlEEJcQTIMO-nSQwtb-GSdsX46e9gbRoP9yGQ11I0rEuycunu6PHx1QnPhxm3SFN15MOlYEFJZtf0dUywMbwZOeBGsrKNLYB54-1R9WNqVdki7usim6VmQphf7mnpshiQRhNAXdoOfMyX3OgMlKtz0cGEcF27uLSul3mewjPjgOOoDukxjPS9rqfh0pb-8zs6aBSt_7505aZ7B9xOi0T9YKW4UooVsr0zB1BTrWQJ3EL-oWcZ572GxFoezCk37QLe3897-B2i2U62uBAAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<!-- this is semantically the same as the above -->\n<Table data={fruits}>\n\t{#snippet header()}\n\t\t<th>fruit</th>\n\t\t<th>qty</th>\n\t\t<th>price</th>\n\t\t<th>total</th>\n\t{/snippet}\n\n\t{#snippet row(d)}\n\t\t<td>{d.name}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.qty}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.price}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.qty * d.price}</td>\n\t{/snippet}\n</Table>\n```\n\n### Implicit `children` snippet\n\nAny content inside the component tags that is _not_ a snippet declaration implicitly becomes part of the `children` snippet ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WOQQrCMBBFrzIMggql3ddY1Du4si5sOmIwnYRkFKX07lKqglqX8_7_w2uRDw1hjlsWI5ZqTPBoLEXMdy3K3fdZDzB5Ndfep_FKVnpWHSKNce1YiCVijirqYLwUJQOYxrsgsLmIOIZjcA1M02w4n-PpomSVvTclqyEutDX6DA2pZ7_ABIVugrmEC3XJH92P55_G39GodCmWBFrQJ2PrQAwdLGHig_NxNv9xrQa1dhWIawrv1Wzeqawa8953D-8QOmaEAQAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<!--- file: App.svelte --->\n<Button>click me</Button>\n```\n\n```svelte\n<!--- file: Button.svelte --->\n<script>\n\tlet { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n<!-- result will be <button>click me</button> -->\n<button>{@render children()}</button>\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] Note that you cannot have a prop called `children` if you also have content inside the component — for this reason, you should avoid having props with that name\n\n### Optional snippet props\n\nYou can declare snippet props as being optional. You can either use optional chaining to not render anything if the snippet isn't set...\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    let { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{@render children?.()}\n```\n\n...or use an `#if` block to render fallback content:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    let { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{#if children}\n    {@render children()}\n{:else}\n    fallback content\n{/if}\n```\n\n## Typing snippets\n\nSnippets implement the `Snippet` interface imported from `'svelte'`:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\">\n\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\n\n\tinterface Props {\n\t\tdata: any[];\n\t\tchildren: Snippet;\n\t\trow: Snippet<[any]>;\n\t}\n\n\tlet { data, children, row }: Props = $props();\n</script>\n```\n\nWith this change, red squigglies will appear if you try and use the component without providing a `data` prop and a `row` snippet. Notice that the type argument provided to `Snippet` is a tuple, since snippets can have multiple parameters.\n\nWe can tighten things up further by declaring a generic, so that `data` and `row` refer to the same type:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\" generics=\"T\">\n\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\n\n\tlet {\n\t\tdata,\n\t\tchildren,\n\t\trow\n\t}: {\n\t\tdata: T[];\n\t\tchildren: Snippet;\n\t\trow: Snippet<[T]>;\n\t} = $props();\n</script>\n```\n\n## Exporting snippets\n\nSnippets declared at the top level of a `.svelte` file can be exported from a `<script module>` for use in other components, provided they don't reference any declarations in a non-module `<script>` (whether directly or indirectly, via other snippets) ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WPwY7CMAxEf8UyB1hRgdhjl13Bga8gHFJipEqtGyUGFUX5dxJUtEB3b9bYM_MckHVLWOKut50TMuC5tpbEY4GnuiGP5T6gXG0-ykLSB8vW2oW_UCNZq7Snv_Rjx0Kc4kpc-6OrrfwoVlK3uQ4CaGMgwsl1LUwXy0f54J9-KV4vf20cNo7YkMu22aqAz4-oOLUI9YKluDPF4h_at-hX5PFyzA1tZ84N3fGpf8YfUU6GvDumLqDKmEqCjjCHUEX4hqDTWCU5PJ6Or38c4g1cPu9tnAEAAA==)):\n\n```svelte\n<script module>\n\texport { add };\n</script>\n\n{#snippet add(a, b)}\n\t{a} + {b} = {a + b}\n{/snippet}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This requires Svelte 5.5.0 or newer\n\n## Programmatic snippets\n\nSnippets can be created programmatically with the [`createRawSnippet`](svelte#createRawSnippet) API. This is intended for advanced use cases.\n\n## Snippets and slots\n\nIn Svelte 4, content can be passed to components using [slots](legacy-slots). Snippets are more powerful and flexible, and so slots have been deprecated in Svelte 5.\n\n---\n\n## {@render ...}\n\nTo render a [snippet](snippet), use a `{@render ...}` tag.\n\n```svelte\n{#snippet sum(a, b)}\n\t<p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}</p>\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render sum(1, 2)}\n{@render sum(3, 4)}\n{@render sum(5, 6)}\n```\n\nThe expression can be an identifier like `sum`, or an arbitrary JavaScript expression:\n\n```svelte\n{@render (cool ? coolSnippet : lameSnippet)()}\n```\n\n## Optional snippets\n\nIf the snippet is potentially undefined — for example, because it's an incoming prop — then you can use optional chaining to only render it when it _is_ defined:\n\n```svelte\n{@render children?.()}\n```\n\nAlternatively, use an [`{#if ...}`](if) block with an `:else` clause to render fallback content:\n\n```svelte\n{#if children}\n\t{@render children()}\n{:else}\n\t<p>fallback content</p>\n{/if}\n```"

Create a component with a hardcoded array of 3 book titles (strings) - \"The Lord of the Rings\", \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", and \"1984\"\n2. Create a snippet called `title` that takes a book title string as a parameter\n3. The snippet should display the book title in a `<span>` element with `data-testid=\"book-title\"`\n4. Use the `{@render ...}` syntax to render the snippet for each book title in a list\n5. Each rendered title should be wrapped in a `<li>` element with `data-testid=\"book-item\"`\n\n## Example HTML structure:\n\n```html\n<ul>\n  <li data-testid=\"book-item\">The Lord of the Rings</li>\n  <li data-testid=\"book-item\">To Kill a Mockingbird</li>\n  <li data-testid=\"book-item\">1984</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nPlease implement this component using Svelte 5 runes.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: When you have finished implementing the component, use the ResultWrite tool to output your final Svelte component code. Only output the component code itself, no explanations or markdown formatting."

You cannot use rest parameters, however.\n\n## Snippet scope\n\nSnippets can be declared anywhere inside your component.

As such, they can be passed to components as props ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3VS247aMBD9lZGpBGwDASRegonaPvQL2qdlH5zYEKvBNvbQLbL875VzAcKyj3PmzJnLGU8UOwqSkd8KJdaCk4TsZS0cyV49wYuJuQiQpGd-N2bu_ooaI1YwJ57hpVYoFDqSEepKKw3mO7VDeTTaIvxiRS1gb_URxvO0ibrS8WanIrHUyiHs7Vmigy28RmyHHmKvDMbMmFq4cQInvGSwTsBYWYoMVhCSB2rBFFPsyl0uruTlR3JZCWvlTXl1Yy_mawiR_rbZKZrellJ-5JQ0RiBUgnFhJ9OGR7HKmwVoilXeIye8DOJGfYCgRlZ3iE876TBsZPX7hPdteO75PC4QaIo8vwNPePmANQ2fMeEFHrLD7rR1jTNkW986E8C3KwfwVr8HSHOSEBT_kGRozyIkn_zQveXDL3rIfPJHtUDwzShJd_Qk3gQCbOGLsdq4yfTRJopRuin3I7nv6kL7ARRjmLdBDG3uv1mhuLA3V2mKtqNEf_oCn8p9aN-WYqH5peP4kWBl1UwJzAEPT9U7K--0fRrrWnPTXpCm1_EVdXjpNmlA8G1hPPyM1fKgMqjFHjctXGjLhZ05w0qpDhksGrybuNEHtJnCalZWsuaTlfq6nPaaBSv_HKw-K57BjzOiVj9ZKQYKzQjZodYFqydYTRN4gPhVzTDO2xnma3HsVWjaLjT8nbfwHy7Q5f2dBAAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\timport Table from './Table.svelte';\n\n\tconst fruits = [\n\t\t{ name: 'apples', qty: 5, price: 2 },\n\t\t{ name: 'bananas', qty: 10, price: 1 },\n\t\t{ name: 'cherries', qty: 20, price: 0.5 }\n\t];\n</script>\n\n{#snippet header()}\n\t<th>fruit</th>\n\t<th>qty</th>\n\t<th>price</th>\n\t<th>total</th>\n{/snippet}\n\n{#snippet row(d)}\n\t<td>{d.name}</td>\n\t<td>{d.qty}</td>\n\t<td>{d.price}</td>\n\t<td>{d.qty * d.price}</td>\n{/snippet}\n\n<Table data={fruits} {header} {row} />\n```\n\nThink about it like passing content instead of data to a component. The concept is similar to slots in web components.\n\n### Implicit props\n\nAs an authoring convenience, snippets declared directly _inside_ a component implicitly become props _on_ the component ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3VSTa_aMBD8Kyu_SkAbCA-JSzBR20N_QXt6vIMTO8SqsY29tI2s_PcqTiB8vaPHs7MzuxuIZgdBMvJLo0QlOElIJZXwJHsLBBvb_XUASc7Mb9Yu_B-hsMMK5sUzvDQahUZPMkJ96aTFfKd3KA_WOISfrFACKmcOMFmk8TWUTjY73RFLoz1C5U4SPWzhrcN2GKDrlcGEWauEnyRwxCaDdQLWyVJksII2uaMWTDPNLtzX5YX8-kgua-GcHJVXI3u5WEPb0d83O03TMZSmfRzOkG1Db7mNacOL19JagVALxoWbztq-H8U6j0SaYp2P2BGbOyQ2v8PQIFMXLKRDk177pq0zf6d8bMrzwBdd0pamyPMb-IjNEzS2f86Gz_Dwf-2F9nvNSUJQ_EOSoTuJNvngqK5v4Pas7n4-OCwlEEJcQTIMO-nSQwtb-GSdsX46e9gbRoP9yGQ11I0rEuycunu6PHx1QnPhxm3SFN15MOlYEFJZtf0dUywMbwZOeBGsrKNLYB54-1R9WNqVdki7usim6VmQphf7mnpshiQRhNAXdoOfMyX3OgMlKtz0cGEcF27uLSul3mewjPjgOOoDukxjPS9rqfh0pb-8zs6aBSt_7505aZ7B9xOi0T9YKW4UooVsr0zB1BTrWQJ3EL-oWcZ572GxFoezCk37QLe3897-B2i2U62uBAAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<!-- this is semantically the same as the above -->\n<Table data={fruits}>\n\t{#snippet header()}\n\t\t<th>fruit</th>\n\t\t<th>qty</th>\n\t\t<th>price</th>\n\t\t<th>total</th>\n\t{/snippet}\n\n\t{#snippet row(d)}\n\t\t<td>{d.name}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.qty}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.price}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.qty * d.price}</td>\n\t{/snippet}\n</Table>\n```\n\n### Implicit `children` snippet\n\nAny content inside the component tags that is _not_ a snippet declaration implicitly becomes part of the `children` snippet ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WOQQrCMBBFrzIMggql3ddY1Du4si5sOmIwnYRkFKX07lKqglqX8_7_w2uRDw1hjlsWI5ZqTPBoLEXMdy3K3fdZDzB5Ndfep_FKVnpWHSKNce1YiCVijirqYLwUJQOYxrsgsLmIOIZjcA1M02w4n-PpomSVvTclqyEutDX6DA2pZ7_ABIVugrmEC3XJH92P55_G39GodCmWBFrQJ2PrQAwdLGHig_NxNv9xrQa1dhWIawrv1Wzeqawa8953D-8QOmaEAQAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<!--- file: App.svelte --->\n<Button>click me</Button>\n```\n\n```svelte\n<!--- file: Button.svelte --->\n<script>\n\tlet { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n<!-- result will be <button>click me</button> -->\n<button>{@render children()}</button>\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] Note that you cannot have a prop called `children` if you also have content inside the component — for this reason, you should avoid having props with that name\n\n### Optional snippet props\n\nYou can declare snippet props as being optional. You can either use optional chaining to not render anything if the snippet isn't set...\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    let { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{@render children?.()}\n```\n\n...or use an `#if` block to render fallback content:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    let { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{#if children}\n    {@render children()}\n{:else}\n    fallback content\n{/if}\n```\n\n## Typing snippets\n\nSnippets implement the `Snippet` interface imported from `'svelte'`:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\">\n\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\n\n\tinterface Props {\n\t\tdata: any[];\n\t\tchildren: Snippet;\n\t\trow: Snippet<[any]>;\n\t}\n\n\tlet { data, children, row }: Props = $props();\n</script>\n```\n\nWith this change, red squigglies will appear if you try and use the component without providing a `data` prop and a `row` snippet. Notice that the type argument provided to `Snippet` is a tuple, since snippets can have multiple parameters.\n\nWe can tighten things up further by declaring a generic, so that `data` and `row` refer to the same type:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\" generics=\"T\">\n\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\n\n\tlet {\n\t\tdata,\n\t\tchildren,\n\t\trow\n\t}: {\n\t\tdata: T[];\n\t\tchildren: Snippet;\n\t\trow: Snippet<[T]>;\n\t} = $props();\n</script>\n```\n\n## Exporting snippets\n\nSnippets declared at the top level of a `.svelte` file can be exported from a `<script module>` for use in other components, provided they don't reference any declarations in a non-module `<script>` (whether directly or indirectly, via other snippets) ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WPwY7CMAxEf8UyB1hRgdhjl13Bga8gHFJipEqtGyUGFUX5dxJUtEB3b9bYM_MckHVLWOKut50TMuC5tpbEY4GnuiGP5T6gXG0-ykLSB8vW2oW_UCNZq7Snv_Rjx0Kc4kpc-6OrrfwoVlK3uQ4CaGMgwsl1LUwXy0f54J9-KV4vf20cNo7YkMu22aqAz4-oOLUI9YKluDPF4h_at-hX5PFyzA1tZ84N3fGpf8YfUU6GvDumLqDKmEqCjjCHUEX4hqDTWCU5PJ6Or38c4g1cPu9tnAEAAA==)):\n\n```svelte\n<script module>\n\texport { add };\n</script>\n\n{#snippet add(a, b)}\n\t{a} + {b} = {a + b}\n{/snippet}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This requires Svelte 5.5.0 or newer\n\n## Programmatic snippets\n\nSnippets can be created programmatically with the [`createRawSnippet`](svelte#createRawSnippet) API. This is intended for advanced use cases.\n\n## Snippets and slots\n\nIn Svelte 4, content can be passed to components using [slots](legacy-slots). Snippets are more powerful and flexible, and so slots have been deprecated in Svelte 5.\n\n---\n\n## {@render ...}\n\nTo render a [snippet](snippet), use a `{@render ...}` tag.\n\n```svelte\n{#snippet sum(a, b)}\n\t<p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}</p>\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render sum(1, 2)}\n{@render sum(3, 4)}\n{@render sum(5, 6)}\n```\n\nThe expression can be an identifier like `sum`, or an arbitrary JavaScript expression:\n\n```svelte\n{@render (cool ? coolSnippet : lameSnippet)()}\n```\n\n## Optional snippets\n\nIf the snippet is potentially undefined — for example, because it's an incoming prop — then you can use optional chaining to only render it when it _is_ defined:\n\n```svelte\n{@render children?.()}\n```\n\nAlternatively, use an [`{#if ...}`](if) block with an `:else` clause to render fallback content:\n\n```svelte\n{#if children}\n\t{@render children()}\n{:else}\n\t<p>fallback content</p>\n{/if}\n```"

You cannot use rest parameters, however.\n\n## Snippet scope\n\nSnippets can be declared anywhere inside your component. They can reference values declared outside themselves, for example in the `<script>` tag or in `{#each ...}` blocks ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE12P0QrCMAxFfyWrwhSEvc8p-h1OcG5RC10bmkyQ0n-3HQPBx3vCPUmCemiDrOpLULYbUdXqTKR2Sj6UA7_RCKbMbvJ9Jg33XpMcW9uKQYEAIzJ3T4QD3LSUDE-PnYA4YET4uOkGMc3W5B3xZrtvbVP9HDas2GqiZHqhMW6Tr9jGbG_oOCMImcUCwrIpFk1FqRyqpRpn0cmjHdAvnrIzuscyq_4nd3dPPD01ukE_NA6qFj9hvMYvGjJADw8BAAA=))...\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet { message = `it's great to see you!` } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{#snippet hello(name)}\n\t<p>hello {name}! {message}!</p>\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render hello('alice')}\n{@render hello('bob')}\n```\n\n...and they are 'visible' to everything in the same lexical scope (i.e. siblings, and children of those siblings):\n\n```svelte\n<div>\n\t{#snippet x()}\n\t\t{#snippet y()}...{/snippet}\n\n\t\t<!-- this is fine -->\n\t\t{@render y()}\n\t{/snippet}\n\n\t<!-- this will error, as `y` is not in scope -->\n\t{@render y()}\n</div>\n\n<!-- this will also error, as `x` is not in scope -->\n{@render x()}\n```\n\nSnippets can reference themselves and each other ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE2WPTQqDMBCFrxLiRqH1Zysi7TlqF1YnENBJSGJLCYGeo5tesUeosfYH3c2bee_jjaWMd6BpfrAU6x5oTvdS0g01V-mFPkNnYNRaDKrxGxto5FKCIaeu1kYwFkauwsoUWtZYPh_3W5FMY4U2mb3egL9kIwY0rbhgiO-sDTgjSEqSTvIDs-jiOP7i_MHuFGAL6p9BtiSbOTl0GtzCuihqE87cqtyam6WRGz_vRcsZh5bmRg3gju4Fptq_kzQBAAA=)):\n\n```svelte\n{#snippet blastoff()}\n\t<span>🚀</span>\n{/snippet}\n\n{#snippet countdown(n)}\n\t{#if n > 0}\n\t\t<span>{n}...</span>\n\t\t{@render countdown(n - 1)}\n\t{:else}\n\t\t{@render blastoff()}\n\t{/if}\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render countdown(10)}\n```\n\n## Passing snippets to components\n\n### Explicit props\n\nWithin the template, snippets are values just like any other. As such, they can be passed to components as props ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3VS247aMBD9lZGpBGwDASRegonaPvQL2qdlH5zYEKvBNvbQLbL875VzAcKyj3PmzJnLGU8UOwqSkd8KJdaCk4TsZS0cyV49wYuJuQiQpGd-N2bu_ooaI1YwJ57hpVYoFDqSEepKKw3mO7VDeTTaIvxiRS1gb_URxvO0ibrS8WanIrHUyiHs7Vmigy28RmyHHmKvDMbMmFq4cQInvGSwTsBYWYoMVhCSB2rBFFPsyl0uruTlR3JZCWvlTXl1Yy_mawiR_rbZKZrellJ-5JQ0RiBUgnFhJ9OGR7HKmwVoilXeIye8DOJGfYCgRlZ3iE876TBsZPX7hPdteO75PC4QaIo8vwNPePmANQ2fMeEFHrLD7rR1jTNkW986E8C3KwfwVr8HSHOSEBT_kGRozyIkn_zQveXDL3rIfPJHtUDwzShJd_Qk3gQCbOGLsdq4yfTRJopRuin3I7nv6kL7ARRjmLdBDG3uv1mhuLA3V2mKtqNEf_oCn8p9aN-WYqH5peP4kWBl1UwJzAEPT9U7K--0fRrrWnPTXpCm1_EVdXjpNmlA8G1hPPyM1fKgMqjFHjctXGjLhZ05w0qpDhksGrybuNEHtJnCalZWsuaTlfq6nPaaBSv_HKw-K57BjzOiVj9ZKQYKzQjZodYFqydYTRN4gPhVzTDO2xnma3HsVWjaLjT8nbfwHy7Q5f2dBAAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\timport Table from './Table.svelte';\n\n\tconst fruits = [\n\t\t{ name: 'apples', qty: 5, price: 2 },\n\t\t{ name: 'bananas', qty: 10, price: 1 },\n\t\t{ name: 'cherries', qty: 20, price: 0.5 }\n\t];\n</script>\n\n{#snippet header()}\n\t<th>fruit</th>\n\t<th>qty</th>\n\t<th>price</th>\n\t<th>total</th>\n{/snippet}\n\n{#snippet row(d)}\n\t<td>{d.name}</td>\n\t<td>{d.qty}</td>\n\t<td>{d.price}</td>\n\t<td>{d.qty * d.price}</td>\n{/snippet}\n\n<Table data={fruits} {header} {row} />\n```\n\nThink about it like passing content instead of data to a component. The concept is similar to slots in web components.\n\n### Implicit props\n\nAs an authoring convenience, snippets declared directly _inside_ a component implicitly become props _on_ the component ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3VSTa_aMBD8Kyu_SkAbCA-JSzBR20N_QXt6vIMTO8SqsY29tI2s_PcqTiB8vaPHs7MzuxuIZgdBMvJLo0QlOElIJZXwJHsLBBvb_XUASc7Mb9Yu_B-hsMMK5sUzvDQahUZPMkJ96aTFfKd3KA_WOISfrFACKmcOMFmk8TWUTjY73RFLoz1C5U4SPWzhrcN2GKDrlcGEWauEnyRwxCaDdQLWyVJksII2uaMWTDPNLtzX5YX8-kgua-GcHJVXI3u5WEPb0d83O03TMZSmfRzOkG1Db7mNacOL19JagVALxoWbztq-H8U6j0SaYp2P2BGbOyQ2v8PQIFMXLKRDk177pq0zf6d8bMrzwBdd0pamyPMb-IjNEzS2f86Gz_Dwf-2F9nvNSUJQ_EOSoTuJNvngqK5v4Pas7n4-OCwlEEJcQTIMO-nSQwtb-GSdsX46e9gbRoP9yGQ11I0rEuycunu6PHx1QnPhxm3SFN15MOlYEFJZtf0dUywMbwZOeBGsrKNLYB54-1R9WNqVdki7usim6VmQphf7mnpshiQRhNAXdoOfMyX3OgMlKtz0cGEcF27uLSul3mewjPjgOOoDukxjPS9rqfh0pb-8zs6aBSt_7505aZ7B9xOi0T9YKW4UooVsr0zB1BTrWQJ3EL-oWcZ572GxFoezCk37QLe3897-B2i2U62uBAAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<!-- this is semantically the same as the above -->\n<Table data={fruits}>\n\t{#snippet header()}\n\t\t<th>fruit</th>\n\t\t<th>qty</th>\n\t\t<th>price</th>\n\t\t<th>total</th>\n\t{/snippet}\n\n\t{#snippet row(d)}\n\t\t<td>{d.name}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.qty}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.price}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.qty * d.price}</td>\n\t{/snippet}\n</Table>\n```\n\n### Implicit `children` snippet\n\nAny content inside the component tags that is _not_ a snippet declaration implicitly becomes part of the `children` snippet ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WOQQrCMBBFrzIMggql3ddY1Du4si5sOmIwnYRkFKX07lKqglqX8_7_w2uRDw1hjlsWI5ZqTPBoLEXMdy3K3fdZDzB5Ndfep_FKVnpWHSKNce1YiCVijirqYLwUJQOYxrsgsLmIOIZjcA1M02w4n-PpomSVvTclqyEutDX6DA2pZ7_ABIVugrmEC3XJH92P55_G39GodCmWBFrQJ2PrQAwdLGHig_NxNv9xrQa1dhWIawrv1Wzeqawa8953D-8QOmaEAQAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<!--- file: App.svelte --->\n<Button>click me</Button>\n```\n\n```svelte\n<!--- file: Button.svelte --->\n<script>\n\tlet { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n<!-- result will be <button>click me</button> -->\n<button>{@render children()}</button>\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] Note that you cannot have a prop called `children` if you also have content inside the component — for this reason, you should avoid having props with that name\n\n### Optional snippet props\n\nYou can declare snippet props as being optional. You can either use optional chaining to not render anything if the snippet isn't set...\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    let { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{@render children?.()}\n```\n\n...or use an `#if` block to render fallback content:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    let { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{#if children}\n    {@render children()}\n{:else}\n    fallback content\n{/if}\n```\n\n## Typing snippets\n\nSnippets implement the `Snippet` interface imported from `'svelte'`:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\">\n\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\n\n\tinterface Props {\n\t\tdata: any[];\n\t\tchildren: Snippet;\n\t\trow: Snippet<[any]>;\n\t}\n\n\tlet { data, children, row }: Props = $props();\n</script>\n```\n\nWith this change, red squigglies will appear if you try and use the component without providing a `data` prop and a `row` snippet. Notice that the type argument provided to `Snippet` is a tuple, since snippets can have multiple parameters.\n\nWe can tighten things up further by declaring a generic, so that `data` and `row` refer to the same type:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\" generics=\"T\">\n\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\n\n\tlet {\n\t\tdata,\n\t\tchildren,\n\t\trow\n\t}: {\n\t\tdata: T[];\n\t\tchildren: Snippet;\n\t\trow: Snippet<[T]>;\n\t} = $props();\n</script>\n```\n\n## Exporting snippets\n\nSnippets declared at the top level of a `.svelte` file can be exported from a `<script module>` for use in other components, provided they don't reference any declarations in a non-module `<script>` (whether directly or indirectly, via other snippets) ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WPwY7CMAxEf8UyB1hRgdhjl13Bga8gHFJipEqtGyUGFUX5dxJUtEB3b9bYM_MckHVLWOKut50TMuC5tpbEY4GnuiGP5T6gXG0-ykLSB8vW2oW_UCNZq7Snv_Rjx0Kc4kpc-6OrrfwoVlK3uQ4CaGMgwsl1LUwXy0f54J9-KV4vf20cNo7YkMu22aqAz4-oOLUI9YKluDPF4h_at-hX5PFyzA1tZ84N3fGpf8YfUU6GvDumLqDKmEqCjjCHUEX4hqDTWCU5PJ6Or38c4g1cPu9tnAEAAA==)):\n\n```svelte\n<script module>\n\texport { add };\n</script>\n\n{#snippet add(a, b)}\n\t{a} + {b} = {a + b}\n{/snippet}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This requires Svelte 5.5.0 or newer\n\n## Programmatic snippets\n\nSnippets can be created programmatically with the [`createRawSnippet`](svelte#createRawSnippet) API. This is intended for advanced use cases.\n\n## Snippets and slots\n\nIn Svelte 4, content can be passed to components using [slots](legacy-slots). Snippets are more powerful and flexible, and so slots have been deprecated in Svelte 5.\n\n---\n\n## {@render ...}\n\nTo render a [snippet](snippet), use a `{@render ...}` tag.\n\n```svelte\n{#snippet sum(a, b)}\n\t<p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}</p>\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render sum(1, 2)}\n{@render sum(3, 4)}\n{@render sum(5, 6)}\n```\n\nThe expression can be an identifier like `sum`, or an arbitrary JavaScript expression:\n\n```svelte\n{@render (cool ? coolSnippet : lameSnippet)()}\n```\n\n## Optional snippets\n\nIf the snippet is potentially undefined — for example, because it's an incoming prop — then you can use optional chaining to only render it when it _is_ defined:\n\n```svelte\n{@render children?.()}\n```\n\nAlternatively, use an [`{#if ...}`](if) block with an `:else` clause to render fallback content:\n\n```svelte\n{#if children}\n\t{@render children()}\n{:else}\n\t<p>fallback content</p>\n{/if}\n```"

You cannot use rest parameters, however.\n\n## Snippet scope\n\nSnippets can be declared anywhere inside your component. They can reference values declared outside themselves, for example in the `<script>` tag or in `{#each ...}` blocks ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE12P0QrCMAxFfyWrwhSEvc8p-h1OcG5RC10bmkyQ0n-3HQPBx3vCPUmCemiDrOpLULYbUdXqTKR2Sj6UA7_RCKbMbvJ9Jg33XpMcW9uKQYEAIzJ3T4QD3LSUDE-PnYA4YET4uOkGMc3W5B3xZrtvbVP9HDas2GqiZHqhMW6Tr9jGbG_oOCMImcUCwrIpFk1FqRyqpRpn0cmjHdAvnrIzuscyq_4nd3dPPD01ukE_NA6qFj9hvMYvGjJADw8BAAA=))...\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet { message = `it's great to see you!` } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{#snippet hello(name)}\n\t<p>hello {name}! {message}!</p>\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render hello('alice')}\n{@render hello('bob')}\n```\n\n...and they are 'visible' to everything in the same lexical scope (i.e. siblings, and children of those siblings):\n\n```svelte\n<div>\n\t{#snippet x()}\n\t\t{#snippet y()}...{/snippet}\n\n\t\t<!-- this is fine -->\n\t\t{@render y()}\n\t{/snippet}\n\n\t<!-- this will error, as `y` is not in scope -->\n\t{@render y()}\n</div>\n\n<!-- this will also error, as `x` is not in scope -->\n{@render x()}\n```\n\nSnippets can reference themselves and each other ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE2WPTQqDMBCFrxLiRqH1Zysi7TlqF1YnENBJSGJLCYGeo5tesUeosfYH3c2bee_jjaWMd6BpfrAU6x5oTvdS0g01V-mFPkNnYNRaDKrxGxto5FKCIaeu1kYwFkauwsoUWtZYPh_3W5FMY4U2mb3egL9kIwY0rbhgiO-sDTgjSEqSTvIDs-jiOP7i_MHuFGAL6p9BtiSbOTl0GtzCuihqE87cqtyam6WRGz_vRcsZh5bmRg3gju4Fptq_kzQBAAA=)):\n\n```svelte\n{#snippet blastoff()}\n\t<span>🚀</span>\n{/snippet}\n\n{#snippet countdown(n)}\n\t{#if n > 0}\n\t\t<span>{n}...</span>\n\t\t{@render countdown(n - 1)}\n\t{:else}\n\t\t{@render blastoff()}\n\t{/if}\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render countdown(10)}\n```\n\n## Passing snippets to components\n\n### Explicit props\n\nWithin the template, snippets are values just like any other. As such, they can be passed to components as props ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3VS247aMBD9lZGpBGwDASRegonaPvQL2qdlH5zYEKvBNvbQLbL875VzAcKyj3PmzJnLGU8UOwqSkd8KJdaCk4TsZS0cyV49wYuJuQiQpGd-N2bu_ooaI1YwJ57hpVYoFDqSEepKKw3mO7VDeTTaIvxiRS1gb_URxvO0ibrS8WanIrHUyiHs7Vmigy28RmyHHmKvDMbMmFq4cQInvGSwTsBYWYoMVhCSB2rBFFPsyl0uruTlR3JZCWvlTXl1Yy_mawiR_rbZKZrellJ-5JQ0RiBUgnFhJ9OGR7HKmwVoilXeIye8DOJGfYCgRlZ3iE876TBsZPX7hPdteO75PC4QaIo8vwNPePmANQ2fMeEFHrLD7rR1jTNkW986E8C3KwfwVr8HSHOSEBT_kGRozyIkn_zQveXDL3rIfPJHtUDwzShJd_Qk3gQCbOGLsdq4yfTRJopRuin3I7nv6kL7ARRjmLdBDG3uv1mhuLA3V2mKtqNEf_oCn8p9aN-WYqH5peP4kWBl1UwJzAEPT9U7K--0fRrrWnPTXpCm1_EVdXjpNmlA8G1hPPyM1fKgMqjFHjctXGjLhZ05w0qpDhksGrybuNEHtJnCalZWsuaTlfq6nPaaBSv_HKw-K57BjzOiVj9ZKQYKzQjZodYFqydYTRN4gPhVzTDO2xnma3HsVWjaLjT8nbfwHy7Q5f2dBAAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\timport Table from './Table.svelte';\n\n\tconst fruits = [\n\t\t{ name: 'apples', qty: 5, price: 2 },\n\t\t{ name: 'bananas', qty: 10, price: 1 },\n\t\t{ name: 'cherries', qty: 20, price: 0.5 }\n\t];\n</script>\n\n{#snippet header()}\n\t<th>fruit</th>\n\t<th>qty</th>\n\t<th>price</th>\n\t<th>total</th>\n{/snippet}\n\n{#snippet row(d)}\n\t<td>{d.name}</td>\n\t<td>{d.qty}</td>\n\t<td>{d.price}</td>\n\t<td>{d.qty * d.price}</td>\n{/snippet}\n\n<Table data={fruits} {header} {row} />\n```\n\nThink about it like passing content instead of data to a component. The concept is similar to slots in web components.\n\n### Implicit props\n\nAs an authoring convenience, snippets declared directly _inside_ a component implicitly become props _on_ the component ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3VSTa_aMBD8Kyu_SkAbCA-JSzBR20N_QXt6vIMTO8SqsY29tI2s_PcqTiB8vaPHs7MzuxuIZgdBMvJLo0QlOElIJZXwJHsLBBvb_XUASc7Mb9Yu_B-hsMMK5sUzvDQahUZPMkJ96aTFfKd3KA_WOISfrFACKmcOMFmk8TWUTjY73RFLoz1C5U4SPWzhrcN2GKDrlcGEWauEnyRwxCaDdQLWyVJksII2uaMWTDPNLtzX5YX8-kgua-GcHJVXI3u5WEPb0d83O03TMZSmfRzOkG1Db7mNacOL19JagVALxoWbztq-H8U6j0SaYp2P2BGbOyQ2v8PQIFMXLKRDk177pq0zf6d8bMrzwBdd0pamyPMb-IjNEzS2f86Gz_Dwf-2F9nvNSUJQ_EOSoTuJNvngqK5v4Pas7n4-OCwlEEJcQTIMO-nSQwtb-GSdsX46e9gbRoP9yGQ11I0rEuycunu6PHx1QnPhxm3SFN15MOlYEFJZtf0dUywMbwZOeBGsrKNLYB54-1R9WNqVdki7usim6VmQphf7mnpshiQRhNAXdoOfMyX3OgMlKtz0cGEcF27uLSul3mewjPjgOOoDukxjPS9rqfh0pb-8zs6aBSt_7505aZ7B9xOi0T9YKW4UooVsr0zB1BTrWQJ3EL-oWcZ572GxFoezCk37QLe3897-B2i2U62uBAAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<!-- this is semantically the same as the above -->\n<Table data={fruits}>\n\t{#snippet header()}\n\t\t<th>fruit</th>\n\t\t<th>qty</th>\n\t\t<th>price</th>\n\t\t<th>total</th>\n\t{/snippet}\n\n\t{#snippet row(d)}\n\t\t<td>{d.name}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.qty}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.price}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.qty * d.price}</td>\n\t{/snippet}\n</Table>\n```\n\n### Implicit `children` snippet\n\nAny content inside the component tags that is _not_ a snippet declaration implicitly becomes part of the `children` snippet ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WOQQrCMBBFrzIMggql3ddY1Du4si5sOmIwnYRkFKX07lKqglqX8_7_w2uRDw1hjlsWI5ZqTPBoLEXMdy3K3fdZDzB5Ndfep_FKVnpWHSKNce1YiCVijirqYLwUJQOYxrsgsLmIOIZjcA1M02w4n-PpomSVvTclqyEutDX6DA2pZ7_ABIVugrmEC3XJH92P55_G39GodCmWBFrQJ2PrQAwdLGHig_NxNv9xrQa1dhWIawrv1Wzeqawa8953D-8QOmaEAQAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<!--- file: App.svelte --->\n<Button>click me</Button>\n```\n\n```svelte\n<!--- file: Button.svelte --->\n<script>\n\tlet { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n<!-- result will be <button>click me</button> -->\n<button>{@render children()}</button>\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] Note that you cannot have a prop called `children` if you also have content inside the component — for this reason, you should avoid having props with that name\n\n### Optional snippet props\n\nYou can declare snippet props as being optional. You can either use optional chaining to not render anything if the snippet isn't set...\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    let { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{@render children?.()}\n```\n\n...or use an `#if` block to render fallback content:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    let { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{#if children}\n    {@render children()}\n{:else}\n    fallback content\n{/if}\n```\n\n## Typing snippets\n\nSnippets implement the `Snippet` interface imported from `'svelte'`:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\">\n\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\n\n\tinterface Props {\n\t\tdata: any[];\n\t\tchildren: Snippet;\n\t\trow: Snippet<[any]>;\n\t}\n\n\tlet { data, children, row }: Props = $props();\n</script>\n```\n\nWith this change, red squigglies will appear if you try and use the component without providing a `data` prop and a `row` snippet. Notice that the type argument provided to `Snippet` is a tuple, since snippets can have multiple parameters.\n\nWe can tighten things up further by declaring a generic, so that `data` and `row` refer to the same type:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\" generics=\"T\">\n\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\n\n\tlet {\n\t\tdata,\n\t\tchildren,\n\t\trow\n\t}: {\n\t\tdata: T[];\n\t\tchildren: Snippet;\n\t\trow: Snippet<[T]>;\n\t} = $props();\n</script>\n```\n\n## Exporting snippets\n\nSnippets declared at the top level of a `.svelte` file can be exported from a `<script module>` for use in other components, provided they don't reference any declarations in a non-module `<script>` (whether directly or indirectly, via other snippets) ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WPwY7CMAxEf8UyB1hRgdhjl13Bga8gHFJipEqtGyUGFUX5dxJUtEB3b9bYM_MckHVLWOKut50TMuC5tpbEY4GnuiGP5T6gXG0-ykLSB8vW2oW_UCNZq7Snv_Rjx0Kc4kpc-6OrrfwoVlK3uQ4CaGMgwsl1LUwXy0f54J9-KV4vf20cNo7YkMu22aqAz4-oOLUI9YKluDPF4h_at-hX5PFyzA1tZ84N3fGpf8YfUU6GvDumLqDKmEqCjjCHUEX4hqDTWCU5PJ6Or38c4g1cPu9tnAEAAA==)):\n\n```svelte\n<script module>\n\texport { add };\n</script>\n\n{#snippet add(a, b)}\n\t{a} + {b} = {a + b}\n{/snippet}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This requires Svelte 5.5.0 or newer\n\n## Programmatic snippets\n\nSnippets can be created programmatically with the [`createRawSnippet`](svelte#createRawSnippet) API. This is intended for advanced use cases.\n\n## Snippets and slots\n\nIn Svelte 4, content can be passed to components using [slots](legacy-slots). Snippets are more powerful and flexible, and so slots have been deprecated in Svelte 5.\n\n---\n\n## {@render ...}\n\nTo render a [snippet](snippet), use a `{@render ...}` tag.\n\n```svelte\n{#snippet sum(a, b)}\n\t<p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}</p>\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render sum(1, 2)}\n{@render sum(3, 4)}\n{@render sum(5, 6)}\n```\n\nThe expression can be an identifier like `sum`, or an arbitrary JavaScript expression:\n\n```svelte\n{@render (cool ? coolSnippet : lameSnippet)()}\n```\n\n## Optional snippets\n\nIf the snippet is potentially undefined — for example, because it's an incoming prop — then you can use optional chaining to only render it when it _is_ defined:\n\n```svelte\n{@render children?.()}\n```\n\nAlternatively, use an [`{#if ...}`](if) block with an `:else` clause to render fallback content:\n\n```svelte\n{#if children}\n\t{@render children()}\n{:else}\n\t<p>fallback content</p>\n{/if}\n```"

You cannot use rest parameters, however.\n\n## Snippet scope\n\nSnippets can be declared anywhere inside your component. They can reference values declared outside themselves, for example in the `<script>` tag or in `{#each ...}` blocks ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE12P0QrCMAxFfyWrwhSEvc8p-h1OcG5RC10bmkyQ0n-3HQPBx3vCPUmCemiDrOpLULYbUdXqTKR2Sj6UA7_RCKbMbvJ9Jg33XpMcW9uKQYEAIzJ3T4QD3LSUDE-PnYA4YET4uOkGMc3W5B3xZrtvbVP9HDas2GqiZHqhMW6Tr9jGbG_oOCMImcUCwrIpFk1FqRyqpRpn0cmjHdAvnrIzuscyq_4nd3dPPD01ukE_NA6qFj9hvMYvGjJADw8BAAA=))...\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet { message = `it's great to see you!` } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{#snippet hello(name)}\n\t<p>hello {name}! {message}!</p>\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render hello('alice')}\n{@render hello('bob')}\n```\n\n...and they are 'visible' to everything in the same lexical scope (i.e. siblings, and children of those siblings):\n\n```svelte\n<div>\n\t{#snippet x()}\n\t\t{#snippet y()}...{/snippet}\n\n\t\t<!-- this is fine -->\n\t\t{@render y()}\n\t{/snippet}\n\n\t<!-- this will error, as `y` is not in scope -->\n\t{@render y()}\n</div>\n\n<!-- this will also error, as `x` is not in scope -->\n{@render x()}\n```\n\nSnippets can reference themselves and each other ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE2WPTQqDMBCFrxLiRqH1Zysi7TlqF1YnENBJSGJLCYGeo5tesUeosfYH3c2bee_jjaWMd6BpfrAU6x5oTvdS0g01V-mFPkNnYNRaDKrxGxto5FKCIaeu1kYwFkauwsoUWtZYPh_3W5FMY4U2mb3egL9kIwY0rbhgiO-sDTgjSEqSTvIDs-jiOP7i_MHuFGAL6p9BtiSbOTl0GtzCuihqE87cqtyam6WRGz_vRcsZh5bmRg3gju4Fptq_kzQBAAA=)):\n\n```svelte\n{#snippet blastoff()}\n\t<span>🚀</span>\n{/snippet}\n\n{#snippet countdown(n)}\n\t{#if n > 0}\n\t\t<span>{n}...</span>\n\t\t{@render countdown(n - 1)}\n\t{:else}\n\t\t{@render blastoff()}\n\t{/if}\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render countdown(10)}\n```\n\n## Passing snippets to components\n\n### Explicit props\n\nWithin the template, snippets are values just like any other. As such, they can be passed to components as props ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3VS247aMBD9lZGpBGwDASRegonaPvQL2qdlH5zYEKvBNvbQLbL875VzAcKyj3PmzJnLGU8UOwqSkd8KJdaCk4TsZS0cyV49wYuJuQiQpGd-N2bu_ooaI1YwJ57hpVYoFDqSEepKKw3mO7VDeTTaIvxiRS1gb_URxvO0ibrS8WanIrHUyiHs7Vmigy28RmyHHmKvDMbMmFq4cQInvGSwTsBYWYoMVhCSB2rBFFPsyl0uruTlR3JZCWvlTXl1Yy_mawiR_rbZKZrellJ-5JQ0RiBUgnFhJ9OGR7HKmwVoilXeIye8DOJGfYCgRlZ3iE876TBsZPX7hPdteO75PC4QaIo8vwNPePmANQ2fMeEFHrLD7rR1jTNkW986E8C3KwfwVr8HSHOSEBT_kGRozyIkn_zQveXDL3rIfPJHtUDwzShJd_Qk3gQCbOGLsdq4yfTRJopRuin3I7nv6kL7ARRjmLdBDG3uv1mhuLA3V2mKtqNEf_oCn8p9aN-WYqH5peP4kWBl1UwJzAEPT9U7K--0fRrrWnPTXpCm1_EVdXjpNmlA8G1hPPyM1fKgMqjFHjctXGjLhZ05w0qpDhksGrybuNEHtJnCalZWsuaTlfq6nPaaBSv_HKw-K57BjzOiVj9ZKQYKzQjZodYFqydYTRN4gPhVzTDO2xnma3HsVWjaLjT8nbfwHy7Q5f2dBAAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\timport Table from './Table.svelte';\n\n\tconst fruits = [\n\t\t{ name: 'apples', qty: 5, price: 2 },\n\t\t{ name: 'bananas', qty: 10, price: 1 },\n\t\t{ name: 'cherries', qty: 20, price: 0.5 }\n\t];\n</script>\n\n{#snippet header()}\n\t<th>fruit</th>\n\t<th>qty</th>\n\t<th>price</th>\n\t<th>total</th>\n{/snippet}\n\n{#snippet row(d)}\n\t<td>{d.name}</td>\n\t<td>{d.qty}</td>\n\t<td>{d.price}</td>\n\t<td>{d.qty * d.price}</td>\n{/snippet}\n\n<Table data={fruits} {header} {row} />\n```\n\nThink about it like passing content instead of data to a component. The concept is similar to slots in web components.\n\n### Implicit props\n\nAs an authoring convenience, snippets declared directly _inside_ a component implicitly become props _on_ the component ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3VSTa_aMBD8Kyu_SkAbCA-JSzBR20N_QXt6vIMTO8SqsY29tI2s_PcqTiB8vaPHs7MzuxuIZgdBMvJLo0QlOElIJZXwJHsLBBvb_XUASc7Mb9Yu_B-hsMMK5sUzvDQahUZPMkJ96aTFfKd3KA_WOISfrFACKmcOMFmk8TWUTjY73RFLoz1C5U4SPWzhrcN2GKDrlcGEWauEnyRwxCaDdQLWyVJksII2uaMWTDPNLtzX5YX8-kgua-GcHJVXI3u5WEPb0d83O03TMZSmfRzOkG1Db7mNacOL19JagVALxoWbztq-H8U6j0SaYp2P2BGbOyQ2v8PQIFMXLKRDk177pq0zf6d8bMrzwBdd0pamyPMb-IjNEzS2f86Gz_Dwf-2F9nvNSUJQ_EOSoTuJNvngqK5v4Pas7n4-OCwlEEJcQTIMO-nSQwtb-GSdsX46e9gbRoP9yGQ11I0rEuycunu6PHx1QnPhxm3SFN15MOlYEFJZtf0dUywMbwZOeBGsrKNLYB54-1R9WNqVdki7usim6VmQphf7mnpshiQRhNAXdoOfMyX3OgMlKtz0cGEcF27uLSul3mewjPjgOOoDukxjPS9rqfh0pb-8zs6aBSt_7505aZ7B9xOi0T9YKW4UooVsr0zB1BTrWQJ3EL-oWcZ572GxFoezCk37QLe3897-B2i2U62uBAAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<!-- this is semantically the same as the above -->\n<Table data={fruits}>\n\t{#snippet header()}\n\t\t<th>fruit</th>\n\t\t<th>qty</th>\n\t\t<th>price</th>\n\t\t<th>total</th>\n\t{/snippet}\n\n\t{#snippet row(d)}\n\t\t<td>{d.name}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.qty}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.price}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.qty * d.price}</td>\n\t{/snippet}\n</Table>\n```\n\n### Implicit `children` snippet\n\nAny content inside the component tags that is _not_ a snippet declaration implicitly becomes part of the `children` snippet ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WOQQrCMBBFrzIMggql3ddY1Du4si5sOmIwnYRkFKX07lKqglqX8_7_w2uRDw1hjlsWI5ZqTPBoLEXMdy3K3fdZDzB5Ndfep_FKVnpWHSKNce1YiCVijirqYLwUJQOYxrsgsLmIOIZjcA1M02w4n-PpomSVvTclqyEutDX6DA2pZ7_ABIVugrmEC3XJH92P55_G39GodCmWBFrQJ2PrQAwdLGHig_NxNv9xrQa1dhWIawrv1Wzeqawa8953D-8QOmaEAQAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<!--- file: App.svelte --->\n<Button>click me</Button>\n```\n\n```svelte\n<!--- file: Button.svelte --->\n<script>\n\tlet { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n<!-- result will be <button>click me</button> -->\n<button>{@render children()}</button>\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] Note that you cannot have a prop called `children` if you also have content inside the component — for this reason, you should avoid having props with that name\n\n### Optional snippet props\n\nYou can declare snippet props as being optional. You can either use optional chaining to not render anything if the snippet isn't set...\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    let { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{@render children?.()}\n```\n\n...or use an `#if` block to render fallback content:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    let { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{#if children}\n    {@render children()}\n{:else}\n    fallback content\n{/if}\n```\n\n## Typing snippets\n\nSnippets implement the `Snippet` interface imported from `'svelte'`:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\">\n\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\n\n\tinterface Props {\n\t\tdata: any[];\n\t\tchildren: Snippet;\n\t\trow: Snippet<[any]>;\n\t}\n\n\tlet { data, children, row }: Props = $props();\n</script>\n```\n\nWith this change, red squigglies will appear if you try and use the component without providing a `data` prop and a `row` snippet. Notice that the type argument provided to `Snippet` is a tuple, since snippets can have multiple parameters.\n\nWe can tighten things up further by declaring a generic, so that `data` and `row` refer to the same type:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\" generics=\"T\">\n\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\n\n\tlet {\n\t\tdata,\n\t\tchildren,\n\t\trow\n\t}: {\n\t\tdata: T[];\n\t\tchildren: Snippet;\n\t\trow: Snippet<[T]>;\n\t} = $props();\n</script>\n```\n\n## Exporting snippets\n\nSnippets declared at the top level of a `.svelte` file can be exported from a `<script module>` for use in other components, provided they don't reference any declarations in a non-module `<script>` (whether directly or indirectly, via other snippets) ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WPwY7CMAxEf8UyB1hRgdhjl13Bga8gHFJipEqtGyUGFUX5dxJUtEB3b9bYM_MckHVLWOKut50TMuC5tpbEY4GnuiGP5T6gXG0-ykLSB8vW2oW_UCNZq7Snv_Rjx0Kc4kpc-6OrrfwoVlK3uQ4CaGMgwsl1LUwXy0f54J9-KV4vf20cNo7YkMu22aqAz4-oOLUI9YKluDPF4h_at-hX5PFyzA1tZ84N3fGpf8YfUU6GvDumLqDKmEqCjjCHUEX4hqDTWCU5PJ6Or38c4g1cPu9tnAEAAA==)):\n\n```svelte\n<script module>\n\texport { add };\n</script>\n\n{#snippet add(a, b)}\n\t{a} + {b} = {a + b}\n{/snippet}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This requires Svelte 5.5.0 or newer\n\n## Programmatic snippets\n\nSnippets can be created programmatically with the [`createRawSnippet`](svelte#createRawSnippet) API. This is intended for advanced use cases.\n\n## Snippets and slots\n\nIn Svelte 4, content can be passed to components using [slots](legacy-slots). Snippets are more powerful and flexible, and so slots have been deprecated in Svelte 5.\n\n---\n\n## {@render ...}\n\nTo render a [snippet](snippet), use a `{@render ...}` tag.\n\n```svelte\n{#snippet sum(a, b)}\n\t<p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}</p>\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render sum(1, 2)}\n{@render sum(3, 4)}\n{@render sum(5, 6)}\n```\n\nThe expression can be an identifier like `sum`, or an arbitrary JavaScript expression:\n\n```svelte\n{@render (cool ? coolSnippet : lameSnippet)()}\n```\n\n## Optional snippets\n\nIf the snippet is potentially undefined — for example, because it's an incoming prop — then you can use optional chaining to only render it when it _is_ defined:\n\n```svelte\n{@render children?.()}\n```\n\nAlternatively, use an [`{#if ...}`](if) block with an `:else` clause to render fallback content:\n\n```svelte\n{#if children}\n\t{@render children()}\n{:else}\n\t<p>fallback content</p>\n{/if}\n```"
