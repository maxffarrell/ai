# Inspect Demo Component Task

Create a Svelte 5 component that demonstrates the `$inspect` rune functionality.

The component should have a text input starting with "Hello world", use basic `$inspect` to log the value, implement `$inspect(...).with` to track updates with a custom callback, and use `$inspect.trace()` inside an effect. Display the input value and character count.
